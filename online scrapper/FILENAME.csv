This is pretty much the biggest red-alert towards legal nootropics in the US.,1240,8r7ipn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8r7ipn/this_is_pretty_much_the_biggest_redalert_towards/,453,1529058254.0,"So essentially, there’s this bill called Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues (SITSA) Act. It gives the DEA and the attorney general almost completely unchecked power to schedule any drug they see fit without following the currently established legal criteria to ban certain substances. In Section 2, Subsection 3B of the bill, this is the most worrying part that affects many different nootropics from phenibut to adrafinil or even kratom or tianepetine. 

“6)Schedule A
(A)In general
The drug or substance—

(i)has—

(I)a chemical structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(II)an actual or predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(ii)is not—

(I)listed or otherwise included in any other schedule in this section or by regulation of the Attorney General; and

(II)with respect to a particular person, subject to an exemption that is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption.


(B)Predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect
For purpose of this paragraph, a predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system may be based on—

(i)the chemical structure, structure activity relationships, binding receptor assays, or other relevant scientific information about the substance;

(ii)

(I)the current or relative potential for abuse of the substance; and

(II)the clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution, or diversion from legitimate channels, of the substance; or

(iii)the capacity of the substance to cause a state of dependence, including physical or psychological dependence that is similar to or greater than that of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V. “


This is concerning due to Phenibut having a similar pharmaceutical effect to Lyrica (schedule V) nd also being able to be (A) abused, and (B) can cause addiction or dependence similar to benzodiazepines or other GABApentinoids. 

Adrafinil is an analogue of Modafinil, a schedule IV drug, so it’s obvious why that could be banned immediately.

"I just learned that 10 minutes of ""wakeful rest"" (doing nothing / no sensory input) after learning was associated with 40% higher memory retrieval a week later. What are some other cognitive-enhancing phenomena everyone should know?",1173,afwze3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/afwze3/i_just_learned_that_10_minutes_of_wakeful_rest/,99,1547509296.0,"This is something that's important in a world with constant distraction: [Boosting Long-Term Memory via Wakeful Rest: Intentional Rehearsal Is Not Necessary, Consolidation Is Sufficient
](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109542). They gave two groups of people a free recall memory task. One group was then placed in a quiet room with no distractions for 10 minutes afterward, and the other group was given an additional cognitive task for 10 minutes afterward.

>Participants in the high sensory stimulation group completed 10 minutes of a spot-the-difference task, during which they were presented sequentially with 30 picture pairs on a laptop screen [2]. Their task was to identify and point to two differences between each picture pair within a 20-second time limit. Participants were instructed not to talk during the task, and care was taken to ensure that the spot-the-difference task was entirely visual: full instructions as well as a 1-minute practice trial were administered prior to Session 1 in order to minimalize verbalization during the delay. The spot-the-difference task was employed for two key reasons: firstly, it introduced new meaningful material and was cognitively demanding, thereby hampering word list consolidation [1]–[4], [6]. Secondly, it was non-verbal and highly unlike the word lists, thereby minimising potential interference at retrieval between word list memories and filler task memories [1], [2]. That is, the visual spot-the-difference task allowed us to examine the effect of sensory stimulation condition on word list consolidation specifically, without the potential confound of retrieval interference.

>Participants in the minimal sensory stimulation group were instructed to rest quietly in a darkened testing room while the experimenter went to ‘organize the next part of the study’ [2], [3]. To ensure minimal sensory stimulation, all equipment was turned off, and participants had no access to mobile phones, newspapers, etc.

What's interesting is that the additional cognitive task really wasn't that demanding, just pointing out two differences between laptops 30 times. That's not *so* dissimilar to making a comment on Reddit for 10 minutes, organizing your room for 10 minutes, etc. What this points to is the idea that you need rest not only *before* doing a cognitively-demanding task, but *immediately* afterward -- a 40% increase in material retrieval is absolutely insane. Even if commenting on Reddit is only 25% as cognitively demanding as pointing to differences in laptops, that's still a whopping 10% difference which is a full letter grade. 

I suppose to put this into practice you would need to take a 5 to 15 minute wakeful resting period after each chunk or subject that you are learning. So instead of stringing together programming / learning a language, you would pause for 10 minutes after each activity. You should also probably not text or move onto another task, unless the task is something that is similarly restful like walking.

What are some other psychological studies that people should know here?",2019-01-14 18:41:36

Got a threatening message from Cortex Labs - bizarre experience.,723,82q1b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/82q1b6/got_a_threatening_message_from_cortex_labs/,187,1520472602.0,"I rated Cortex Labs on Facebook without leaving a detailed review. Nearly instantaneous, they not only replied to this review, but also sent me a threatening private message:

""You're going to want to remove that review, before we subpoena FB to find the IP address and location of the account your using. You are not a customer of ours, and are posting negative reviews for personal reasons. You have 36 hours to remove this review.""

I then edited my review (and lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1) and added in the details of the private message they sent me. 

Their reply? 

""And that wasn't a threat. It's a promise. Our attorneys don't let people get away with fraudulent public slandering.""

Which is rather strange, considering my initial rating didn't contain a single written word, and the edit only mentioned the threatening message I received from them - so I'm not sure how that could be considered ""slanderous"" in any way.

I told my friend about this experience who then also took to the comments, and we were swiftly accused of being the same person.

Over the next hour, 5 5 star ratings mysteriously appear, raising their average rating again (some having a suspiciously similar writing style). 

Unfortunately, I have since found out [this isn't the first time Cortex Labs has acted very unprofessionally](https://imgur.com/a/qb2rf) and from these sudden 5 star ratings appearing, this also now adds some serious shadiness as well.

Needless to say, this was bizarre. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them?


/edit: It is interesting to review this post a few hours later. Ryan came here with a fake account himself, spewing insults while presenting himself as a personal ""friend"" (the same thing he actually accused others of). He has also now disabled the review section on his Facebook page completely, purging it of ALL reviews in an attempt to hide his poor behavior. 

His product (Cortex Nootropic Stack) can still be reviewed on Amazon.

I also found this [hilarious review](https://www.naturalnootropic.com/cortex-generation-1-review/) where he also felt the need to to vigorously engage with the author in the comments.

My advice to Ryan: Learn some customer relation skills, or even better: Just learn how to be a better person.

/edit 2:
It seems Ryan wasn't content just posting in this thread posing as a friend.

Now he's fighting back, and he has some choice words for users in this subreddit.

He talks about it in his [newest video](https://youtu.be/qnuJSQClxi8?t=36s), essentially calling everyone a loser (with a bad job).

He also mentions this Conor McGregor quote:

>Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.

The irony of saying this while talking about other people (reddit users) seems to have been lost on him.

Unfortunately, it seems he didn't heed my advice about learning some customer relation skills or just being a better person.

All this over a wordless 2 star review that made him threaten me and claim my review was fake, because I didn't order this product from him. I guess he never realized I [could've just ordered it from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cortex-Nootropic-Stack-Performance-Monophospate/dp/B01N26XS8D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), or tried some from a friend?

At this point, I really do feel a little sorry for him - in his own words, he's supposedly a vet who was (or is still) suffering from PTSD. Of course that doesn't excuse his behavior, but I hope he realizes that acting the way he does certainly won't help him OR his business succeed.",2018-03-07 20:30:02

**Conclusion: Jarrow is entirely safe for consumption, as is pure nootropics.** I apologize for casting any doubt on their safety or quality.

edit: Hey everyone FYI, my post title was misleading - upon closer inspection the study focuses on ayurvedic medicines in general and not specifically ashwagandha. On top of that, it didn't study brands that are popular currently (the study is almost a decade old) and so is not by any means an accurate reflection of what you're likely to encounter while shopping online. So it's doubtful that 20% of the Ashwagandha available currently is contaminated with unsafe levels of toxic metals.

That being said, given that there is no regulatory oversight with these products, some amount of wariness and caution is always warranted to some degree.

/End Edit

Almost every post on here involves a few things that I find disturbing: 

1. Recommending something based off of short-term experience. I.e. “just took ashwaganda and it CURED my anxiety!” Chances are it didn’t cure your anxiety, it’s just a temporary patch for the symptoms. Many substances that have positive short-term effects end up being a negative in the long run. In fact, it’s usually the ones that feel the best at first that are the hardest to quit because of the permanent damage you’re doing to your neurotransmitters, and it’s often hard for us to even admit that they’re not good for us. 

2. Casually recommending dosages that are FAR too high for the average person. Everybody’s different, and not everyone should be trying a dosage that happens to work for you, especially because, let’s be frank, many of us are current/former drug users and require more stimulation to affect our mind and behavior. 

3. Underestimating side effects. This is kind of a corollary of the first two, but too often on here i see people saying stuff like “you could try theanine, it’s just an amino acid so there’s no risk”. Or “you don’t build a tolerance”. Regarding ANY psychoactive substance, which includes pretty much every nootropic mentioned on this sub (if you feel different, it’s psychoactive) including substances that we often tout as harmless like theanine or caffeine, you WILL build a tolerance, and this could lead to dependency. 

4. Recommending nootropics for sleep. Nootropics that help us fall asleep don’t necessarily give us BETTER sleep. Even if you feel more refreshed in the morning you may not necessarily be getting healthy sleep. Substances that affect your sleep hormones can change your sleep cycles, causing you to miss the right combination of light, deep, REM and other stages of sleep that all have their own specific purpose for repairing different parts of the body and mind. 
 
And taking these substances habitually to fall asleep will cause you to develop a dependency, meaning you’ll have an even tougher time falling asleep without that substance than you did before you ever took it. If you aren’t getting good sleep there are many other things you can try such as meditation, reducing light exposure at night, keeping a consistent bedtime routine, using your bed for the purpose of sleep ONLY, getting sunlight exposure and/or exercising early in the day, taking a hot shower an hour before bed so your body cools as you get ready for bed (which sends signals to your brain to start producing sleep hormones). 

5. Many of these substances are not well studied and we can’t assume they aren’t doing some sort of long-term damage. There are many things that have been a part of our everyday lives for years before we discovered the extent of their adverse health effects (tobacco, asbestos, sugar, plastics).

6. Assuming that a single benefit, even when proven through scientific study, means that a nootropic is worth taking. Just because a substance has a single benefit doesn’t mean that that benefit outweighs all the risks and damages. Green tea extract, for example, contains healthy anti-oxidants, but it’s also hard on the liver, and proper steps need to be taken to insure that damage to the liver is mitigated and determine whether it’s even worth taking at all. 

Additionally, many vitamins/supplements, while they may be useful to supplement if we are deficient in something essential, can be harmful when taken in excess or when they’re not needed. Many substances, such as magnesium and zinc, compete for absorption within the body, so that even though you may feel that you are helping yourself by supplementing magnesium to help aid digestion, for example, you may be causing a deficiency in zinc, which can cause diarrhea, hair loss, impotence, and all sorts of other health issues. It’s important to GET BLOODWORK done before supplementing and during, to know exactly how you’re affecting your body. Most people can just ask their primary care physician to get bloodwork done for a small fee.

I’m not saying that we should all stay away from nootropics. Some of them can be effective when taken responsibly, by:

1. easing into use with small dosages

2. cycling use

3. taking only one at a time to observe its effects on the body independent of other substances

4. weening one’s self off other more serious substances/drugs

5. After putting serious effort into trying more natural and safer methods that have proven to be more effective over time (meditation, exercise, healthy eating, 8 hours of sleep, hydrating), it’s often said, but is worth reiterating, that if exercise were sold in a pill people would pay top dollar for it. 

Lastly, many psychological issues, such as problems concentrating, anxiety, depression are the result of our lives’s circumstances and our inability to accept them and work to make them better. It may seem impossible at some points in our lives, but we could all benefit from finding people and things that we love and making those our priority. Love and a sense of purpose are more powerful forces than any nootropic out there.",2019-09-22 06:36:43

Why Your Nootropics Arent Working,564,dir6b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dir6b1/why_your_nootropics_arent_working/,191,1571269766.0,"I dove into noots about 10 years ago, around the time Dave Asprey was coming out of hiding and Modafanil was starting to get popular traction. I got involved because like everyone else here, I wanted to perform better in all areas of my life, especially my work, which is very technically obtuse and demanding. I took these compounds very seriously, and they have vastly improved my life.

Along the way I realized a few critical elements that caused ""non response"" to certain doses and compounds. Ive also read far too many accounts here on reddit and other  biohacking forums of people saying things like ""its a placebo"" or, ""This stuff doesn't work"".  If you're experiencing shitty results, id like to offer a few of my observations as to why:

1. ***Your Baseline sucks. -*** If you havent changed the oil in your car in over a year, neglected all your filters, drive on bald tires and generally avoid any maintenance, will a brand new performance exhaust and the most expensive racing fuel make your driving experience any better? If you want performance enhancement drugs to have an impact on your performance, you better make sure the basics are in order - Sleep, Reasonable Nutrition, Hydration and a host of other fundamental elements need to be tight if you want to step up your game with Nootropics. Your brain/body cant use energy systems you've been trashing with Mcdonalds and Vodka for a week.
2. ***You think Noots are NZT-like super drugs -*** This is the most common explanation for why people say ""X compound doesn't work"". No drug on the planet is going to motivate you to put the PlayStation controller down and do what you're supposed to be doing to elevate your life Game. YOU have to cultivate your own motivation to do what your laziness is currently keeping you from doing, and smart drugs will assist you once you get there. If your looking for a drug to ""make you do it"", Nootropics will always leave you disappointed. Take some initiative bro. There is no magic bullet, just bigger and better guns. 'still have to learn to shoot.
3. ***Youre not self-experimenting properly -*** There are about 30 compounds I can think of that will have a profound effect on your performance. Which of those is right for you and what doses can only be answered by one person: YOU. Theres no way a 275lb Bodybuilder with an I.Q. of 30 who sleeps 10 Hrs is going to have the same experience as a 19 y/o weakling studying for the BAR exam who sleeps 4H,  but for some reason, the biohacking community tends to lump these two together in terms of chemical reactions.Do legitimate self-experimental cycles, *one compound at a time,* for an extended period of time before you jump to a conclusion.
4. ***You're not dosing surgically -*** some compounds are only effective at a certain dose range, and that dose is going to be particular to YOUR body. Stop downing fistfuls of shit because you're ""Experienced with drugs, and have a high tolerance to pills"". Do your research. Separate the Signal from the Noise and understand what these compounds actually do inside you, what they deplete and what the consequences of use are. More is almost never better. Start low, and gradually increase if your self experimentation calls for it.
5. **You dont need chemical enhancement, you need to clean your room. -** When i was a competitive power lifter, I took a shit ton of steroids. Some people may argue with the morality of this, but they are clueless to the fact that its what you have to do if you want to win medals at a professional level in this sport, and compete with straight up bio-mutant humans on the platform.Because of my size and performance, Gym Rats and New-bros would ask me all the time, What should I take and what dose? My response was always this: Chemical Performance enhancement is level 10 shit. If your on level 0, meaning you skip the gym, skip meals, get dehydrated daily, drink out every night and sleep for 5 hours you have no biz taking performance enhancement drugs. You're just lazy and looking for a magic bullet. Earn your right to take things to the next level, stop trying to cheat yourself. Come back when you're level 9.

**TLDR: Your Baseline is fucked. You dont sleep enough, eat shitty foods, treat your body & spirit like trash, and expect a pill to turn you into Elon Musk overnight. Drink more water, consume less carbs and social media, get 30 min of light exercise daily, make your bed everyday and I bet a dollar to a doughnut your Noots will ""work"" better.**",2019-10-16 19:49:26

Fruit and vegetable consumption and cognitive decline in aging women.

Kang JH1, Ascherio A, Grodstein F.

Abstract

We prospectively examined fruit and vegetable intake in relation to cognitive function and decline among aging women. Participants were followed from in 1976 with biennial questionnaires, and food frequency questionnaires were administered in 1984, 1986, and every 4 years thereafter. From 1995 to 2001, we administered, by telephone, six cognitive tests measuring general cognition, verbal memory, category fluency, and working memory. We repeated assessments two years later for 13,388 women (>90% follow-up). We averaged dietary intakes from 1984 through the first cognitive assessment, and used linear regression to obtain multivariable-adjusted mean differences in performance and decline in performance across intake levels. **Fruits were not associated with cognition or cognitive decline. However, total vegetable intake was significantly associated with less decline**. Specifically, on a global score combining all tests, women in the highest quintile of **cruciferous vegetables** declined slower (by 0.04 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.003, 0.07; p trend = 0.1) compared with the lowest quintile. Women consuming the most **green leafy** vegetables also experienced slower decline than women consuming the least amount (by 0.05 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.02, 0.09; p trend < 0.001). These mean differences were equivalent to those observed for women about 1 to 2 years apart in age.

Cerebral Health Pyritinol Test Results (WARNING),492,1mmip9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1mmip9/cerebral_health_pyritinol_test_results_warning/,229,1379510752.0,"Many of you may remember the issue that came up with Cerebral Health/Bioscience Nutraceuticals a few months ago, where their choline bitartrate was numbing people's mouths. After sending those samples in to the lab, the tests came back negative for choline bitartrate. We suspected it was choline salacylate, but decided further testing to ascertain the exact compound would not be worth the cost. Unfortunately that was not the last issue to come from Cerebral Health.

A few weeks ago, another Redditor placed an order pyritinol from CH, along with some alpha GPC and oxiracetam. When the order arrived, both the alpha GPC and oxiracetam seemed alright. However, the pyritinol seemed off. Before thinking about it, he took his normal 400mg dose of pyritinol and went out for a mountain bike ride. Within 15-20 minutes he was getting a weird euphoria and detachment. After another couple minutes, his memory gets very fuzzy. 

Eventually his sister found him in the garage in a manic/psychotic state. He was biting his lips very hard, shaking, and holding his fists tight. Eventually he went into seizures when the paramedics came. He was taken to the hospital and seized again while waiting for the doctor. He had a crazed look in his eyes like what you see with people having a psychotic episode on MDPV. He was in the hospital for 4 days.

Not putting two and two together yet, he tried another small dose of pyritinol a few days after getting home, to see what effects came back. Sure enough, he started to get the euphoria and disassociation that he felt before. He also got the same crazed look in his eyes, and same rolling nystagmus. It tasted nothing like pyritinol, but more like burnt plastic. His cognition was off for a while due to the seizures, but he was sure it was the Cerebral Health pyritinol that caused it.

After doing some searching for similar reactions and physical properties online, he came to the conclusion that the compound was most likely a cathinone derivative like MDPV. All the effects fit with an overdose on something like MDPV. Since 400mg is a normal dose for pyritinol, but a massive dose for MDPV, that is most likely what caused the blackout and seizures. Since then he has been having intermittent seizures, and has been back in the hospital 3 times.

After speaking with the other moderators, we decided we needed to send a sample into the lab to get this tested. To prevent any accusations of tampering with the sample, I had another moderator order a whole new bag from them, then send a sample from that into the lab to be tested. So we now have two samples of the compound in question. The original one that sent the Redditor to the hospital, and the separate order we placed right after we became aware of the issue. Today the results came back, and it tested negative for pyritinol. I spoke to Colin at the lab, and he said that the FTIR did not match up at all, and that it was a completely unrelated compound. Due to legal constraints, the lab did not want to do a full workup on the compound apart from confirming it was not pyritinol. So we are going to be sending another sample from the same batch to Dacesafe.org to do a full workup. It will tell us exactly what the compound is, and what purity level it is at.

[Here is the result from Colmeric](http://i.imgur.com/cCOCMUs.jpg)

So in light of this, I suggest that nobody purchases anything from Cerebral Health. This is the second instance in the last 6 months where they have been selling a completely different substance than what it was advertised as. In this particular instance, it could even be a dangerous and illegal substance. Until we do a full workup, I cannot say for sure if this substance was MDPV or another cathinone derivative. However, it is definitely a psychoactive compound other than pyritinol. Obviously a lawyer is going to be brought in by the Redditor that went to the hospital, so I may have to take certain statements down eventually. However, I want everyone to be aware of this serious issue before it potentially puts another person in the hospital!

**EDIT: After further testing, the substance was identified as diphenhydramine (Benadryl).**

In his latest podcast (with Sinclair which was super interesting) he says he takes 3 different nootropic supps all of which have multiple ingredients. 

One of them is trubrain which is-

>L-theanine, Caffeine, Uridine, Centrophenoxine, Magnesium, Tyrosine, N-Acetyl Carnitine, Citicholine, Monk Fruit, Mangosteen, Nopal Concentrate, Noopept, Cane Sugar, Blue Agave, Purified Water, Xylitol, Nisin, Polylysine.

Okay so now what if you have a negative reaction to that? how on earth would you determine which specific ingredient you reacted to? same with a positive reaction. Its possible only one of those ingredients is helping you and the rest are just doing nothing or actually doing damage to your brain chemistry. You dont know!  

Also there are multiple cholinergic substances in that. Too much of that can fuck you up. 

Now consider he ALSO is taking 2 other nootropic supplement which ALSO have multiple ingredients! This is like 30 - 40 nootropic ingredients this man is sucking down for shits and giggles.

He seems to be following the ""Just take ALL the nootropics ALL the time! More and more! Balls to the Wall! Fuck yeah!"" approach

sorry but that if FUCKING STUPID! You are messing with your brain chemistry and turning your body into a ongoing chemistry experiment. Bad. Wrong. No. Dont do it, dont follow his lead. 

Do ONE nootropic at a time, see how you react and then adjust accordingly. 

Fucking Rogan man. How can he be so smart and so fucking stupid at the same time? 

Sorry for the rant but geez louise, this is how you get an industry over regulated.

***So I count 11 separate chemicals that boost acetylcholine levels***. Thats flat out stupid. These chemicals in your brain are supposed to be balanced, not too much not too little. There are multiple systems within your brain designed to regulate this. Taking 11 chemicals designed to wack out your ACH levels is just simply begging to have your brain chemistry fucked up. Unwise.

The biggest mistake beginners make with nootropics,475,cv16e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cv16e5/the_biggest_mistake_beginners_make_with_nootropics/,55,1566720345.0,"I've been testing all kinds of nootropics, supplements and even prescription strength medications for over 15 years, and I've seen a really big issue.  


How many times have you or read about someone taking a supplement and, suddenly, they are cured.  
They have an amazing day. They feel great. Pain is gone, or energy is up. Mood is transformed.   
Everything clicks.  


So much of the testimony on this subreddit is actually these types of account. First day. First week. First 2 weeks.   


But, then what happens?  
The effects are gone. The person returns to baseline. And the whole thing might be forgotten. No long term progress is achieved. 

There are 2 causes for this.   
(1) The placebo effect. (2) A ""Triggering"" effect   


The placebo effect has been well documented and studied so I won't go into it.  
The ""Triggering"" effect is the one I want to highlight because this is where the problem happens.  


Human beings naturally go through mood cycles. Happy days. Sad days. Angry days.   
These moods can even last for few days or even a week or two.   


In the most intense example we have hypo-manic disorder. Where you have extreme episodes alternating between ecstatic/high energy/euphoria/happiness/motivation followed by episodes of depression/irritability/hopelessness.   


That's the most extreme example and it's not something seriously effecting most people. But, the key is understanding these mood cycles.   


As a person goes through their life, they will naturally go through  these sad/happy/angry/etc mood cycles -- btw there is no specific rhythm to this other than a high energy/low energy rhythm mediated by the para-sympathetic/sympathetic nervous system. And all this will happen WITHOUT any supplementation.   


So, when you take a supplement and you happen to be ""ready"" for a positive mood, then that action helps trigger that mood. It's similar to how if a person gets a complement or a kind gesture, and they feel incredible.   


So it's critical to distinguish the intrinsic effects of the supplement versus the natural cycles that are happening.   


Having said that, what's the solution?   
The most important thing is to STOP looking for a ""silver bullet"" or magical cure.   
Most nootropics & supplements offer little immediate cognitive benefits. And those that do, will give you a boost. But they won't ""cure"" you.   


The key is to understand that ""you"" are the cure.   
The quality of your life comes from the quality of your living.   
It's how you sleep, eat, move.   
It's how you take care of yourself mentally and emotionally.  
It's the quality of relationships and deeper meaning to life.   


That's what personally helped me the most, is when I stopped trying to find ""a cure"" and realize that all of life is an on-going process, and I can achieve my goals if I continue to make improvements.   


In that sense, ""fatigue"" or ""low energy"" isn't a ""on/off"" switch.   
It's not binary.   
You aren't tired OR energetic.   
It's a gradient. A scale.

And then it's about asking the question:   
""How do I add more positive inputs to achieve my outcome?""   
And all kinds of nootropics and supplements are part of the process.   


But, ultimately it's so important to stop living life in terms of ""singular events"" i.e. I took a supplement and now my depression is gone. And then if the supplement stops working a few days later, then ""the cure"" has failed and you are back to square 1. It's all an on-going process. You are the scientist of your body and your life, and you continuously conduct experiments to see what works and what does. And then you do more of what works, and less of what doesn't.  


I'm sharing this because this is the biggest piece of advice I'd give myself 15 years ago, because I ended up wasting years and years trying all kinds of ""one time cures"" and not making progress. It wasn't until I embraced the ""process based""/holistic mindset, that I started to achieve my health/mind goals with the help of nootropics.",2019-08-25 04:05:45

A 10+ year nootropic enthusiast’s list of 20 obscure nootropics/supplements you may or may know about,455,bclp1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bclp1g/a_10_year_nootropic_enthusiasts_list_of_20/,191,1555149469.0,"Just thought I’d share my experiences with some not-so-well-known nootropics/supplements I’ve taken. Most of them are Russian, which is probably why there aren’t much user experiences written about them on here or Longecity. Let me know if you want me to go into more detail on any of them or if you have any questions. If some of you find this list helpful I can make more lists of nootropics I’ve tried for different symptoms (mood, cognition, social anxiety, anhedonia). Check out my early post history for more reviews or my old account which I lost the password to and can not access anymore (/u/Nedzilla55). Anyways, here’s my list of 20 not-so-well-know (and a few we’ll know) nootropics/supplements. They’re listed in no particular order.



1) Pantogam and Pantogam Activ - Feels somewhat like Phenibut lite, without the extreme tolerance. Effects are not as intense as phenibut or Baclofen but it’s a nice little anxiolytic which is somewhat energizing as well (as strange as that sounds). Almost like a couple of drinks. Made it easier for me to just be myself (as weird as that sounds). You may find yourself humming in the car or listening to music while doing goofy dance moves from the early 2000s. Makes it easier to laugh and just enjoy myself while being in the moment.


2) Low Dose Amisilpride (12.5mg - 25mg). Don’t let the antipsychotic label scare you: that’s only at regular doses. At very low doses, it enhances dopamine transmission and facilitates dopamineric neurotransission and is a wonderful “as needed” mood brightener. Great for anhedonia. Helps to feel more “in the moment” and makes things like conversations with others more enjoyable.


3) Tenoten - Didn’t feel much from this one unfortunately. It’s supposed to work for anxiety and stress. Not too many experience reports online either (In English, at least). Might as well have been a sugar pill.


4) GABOB - Brain fog, sleepy ness, sedation... not a fan of this one. Benadryl type feeling almost. Not enjoyable at all and overall letdown IME.


5) Picamilon - Developed by Soviet Russia, this is considered a pro drug of GABA. It can be somewhat energizing or anxiolytic depending on the dose. Very subtle though, possible placebo effect. I haven’t found too many positive experiences online with this one either.


6) Agomelatine - This atypical antidepressant is an agonist at the melatonin receptors along with 5-HT2C antagonist. Helps me fall asleep when taken before bedtime, but has an activating/energizing feel upon waking up. Good alternative to try if you’ve had no luck with conventional antidepressants. I've read experience reports about it causing irritation at higher doses. I have not experienced this but YMMV.


7) Afobazole - This obscure little Ruski supplement feels somewhat anxiolytic but effects were pretty subtle to me. I may revisit this one with a higher dosage 


8) Sarcosine+NAC - Ok so this one may not be very obscure but I enjoy its effects so I figured I’d at least share. NAC literally cured my trichtillomania. It’s an amazing antioxidant. Taken an hour before drinking it prevents hangovers IME. Sarcosine is great for anhedonia and other “negative symptoms”. Makes it easier to engage with others and “feel”.


9) Grandaxin - This is an interesting one. Its commonly described as “anxiolytic” and “tranquilizing” though I would not really agree with that description. It’s an It feels activating physically yet quiets the mind. Too big of a dose caused irritability


10) Stresam - Nice little anxiolytic. Helps calm the mind and body. I like it to unwind after a stressful day at work. Puts me in a nice chill state when kicking back and watching documentaries or hanging out in nature


11) BPC-157 - Apparently it’s good for reducing stimulant tolerance and injuries? Again another one that may not be very obscure but I thought it may be of interest to some of you. 


12) Nefiracetam - I love this one. Nice little mood brightener. It’s hard to explain but it helps me connect the dots at work and when doing everyday activities. It makes it easy for me to read between the lines, especially in work/social situations. It’s almost like it makes me feel more aware. Like I was brushing my teeth one day on it and I just zoned out to the feeling of the bristles of my toothbrush going against my teeth and gums and just kind of had me in the moment. It made me think “why do I wet my toothbrush, maybe it’s better to leave it dry because the toothpaste sticks better to the toothbrush and my teeth”. This may or may not be wrong but I’ve had similar epiphanies on it. That may sound dumb but I don’t know how to better describe its effect on me. I wish someone would have this in stock again :(


13) Oxytocin - I took it before an interview and had the best interview in my life. I was so engaged with the interviewer and felt like we already had some sort of connection. It was very easy to express myself. My girlfriend said I was very romantic (lol) when I took it before going out to dinner with her (which is sort of unusual for me). Great for deep convos and connecting with others. This is one of those that I can clearly rule out a placebo effect.


14) Sulbutiamine - I had high hopes for this one but unfortunately did not feel much of anything despite trying many different doses. People on here and Longecity reported energizing effects. Maybe I’m just a non-responder?


15) Galantamine - this one is a cholinesterase inhibitor . Perefct for those who enjoy lucid dreaming. Increases acetylcholine in the brain, which may or may not be a good thing based on your personal neurochemistry. 


16) Semax - These next 2 are not very obscure to those familiar with nootropics but felt I should include them for some reason. This one is activating. I really like it for jogging, hiking, and other outdoor activities.


17) Selank - Semax’s chill twin brother. This one is more anxiolytic. I really enjoy walks in the woods with this one for some reason. Or just sitting on my back porch enjoying the nice weather and scenery.


18) P-21 - R.I.P. Ceretropic :( not sure if this is available anymore but I enjoyed its effects. It had more of an activating feel in my experience. Somewhat anxiogenic at times even. Not in a bad way though. Effects are hard to describe with this one.


19) D-Cycloserine - This one “aids in learning by helping form stronger neural connections”. Good for exposure therapy. I have a feeling this one would work much better when combined with CBT


20) GTS-21 - this one is a partial agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is a horrible smelly yellow substance with a repulsive taste and it leaves yellow stains on anything it touches, including your hands. Felt somewhat anxiolytic though activating at the same time. I’ve only taken it for a week though. I may need to take it for a longer period of time to really feel its effects though. I will trial it for a month and report back it’s effects.",2019-04-13 05:57:49

"After two years of development, we've made the first caffeien + L-theanine nootropic gum!",420,3kgtz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3kgtz4/after_two_years_of_development_weve_made_the/,227,1441953049.0,"Hey r/nootropics!

Nearly two years ago, my brother (best friend) and I began working on NeuroGum, the first sugar-free caffeine + L-theanine nootropic gum. We saw all these other companies charging exorbitant amounts of money simply encapsulating caffeine and L-theanine, and we began brainstorming ways of creating an alternative that was delicious, affordable, and also portable. Beyond that, we wanted a way of making nootropics more accessible to the average consumer.

&nbsp;

So we borrowed some money and began experimenting by putting caffeine and L-theanine into a gum base. Of course, that first iteration tasted terrible and it crumbled apart. After a few unsuccessful attempts, we finally began working with a certified gum chemist, and over a dozen iterations later, we finally found a way of cold compressing:

* 40mg of caffeine
* 60mg of L-theanine
* 30% Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)
* 100% Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)

into a piece of gum. Instead of aspartame, we used sorbitol, stevia, and a natural mint + vanilla flavor mix to mask the flavors and created our very own nootropic gum!

&nbsp;
        
I wanted to share to this subreddit because the amazing content here changed my life. We've been working super hard for the last two years and just launched on Indiegogo today. With the money we raise, we can finish our first production run and get our gum out to as many people as possible.

&nbsp;

You can pre-order here on our Indiegogo page: http://igg.me/at/neurogum

and you can also check out our website at www.neurogum.com!

Once we launch, I promise I'll be back with some coupon codes for everyone here! If there's any questions, feel free to ask! This is my personal account so I'll be lurking in and out between shifts all day.

Cheers guys!

&nbsp;


**EDIT: Wow. I'm absolutely thrilled. Yesterday, our Indiegogo campaign reached our goal, and now we can pay to finish our first production run. It's been such an overwhelming experience receiving feedback, support, and wonderful discussion for all of you here. After we talk with our manufacturer first thing tomorrow morning, we are going to begin working on some stretch goals like different flavors and our L-theanine gum.**

**This subreddit has been so amazing, and I can't be more grateful. Thank you all so much!**
 
**SO, for everyone who has already ordered, we sped up the timeline! We are going to work hard to get the gum shipped out as quickly as possible! We'll finalize the order tomorrow, receive it in two weeks, then set up something to get it out to you. I can't wait for you all to try NeuroGum!**

&nbsp;

**EDIT (PART 2): After feedback, we dropped our price so NeuroGum is less than $3 a pack! Code Redditropics also gives an extra 10% off so you'll get it for even less :)

[A human study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425476) found that 3 months of daily Magnesium supplementation are needed to significantly increase RBC (Red Blood Cell) Magnesium levels. The study used Magnesium Di-Malate (supplement form is usually Magnesium Mono-Malate, should be similar), and Vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as it is known B6 improves Magnesium absorption.

After 30 days, the participants had a 6% higher RBC Mg content. After 90 days, however, the participants had a 30% higher RBC Mg content, which is considered a significant increase. The 6% increase at 30 days could be beneficial as well, but it shows that restoring normal Magnesium stores in the body can take a long time.

Magnesium Malate is known to be well absorbed, but even with its good absorption, it can take as long as 3 months to fix a deficiency. 

****

It seems like many people here decide that a certain Magnesium supplement is useless, after only a few weeks on it, and then switch to another one that they claim to find more effective. What might actually be happening, is that the multiple weeks of being on the first Magnesium supplement partially fixed the deficiency, making the second Magnesium supplement build on top of that, hence having more noticeable effects.",2018-09-13 00:06:19

I recently purchased 100g of what i believed to be Piracetam from Cerebral Health. After 3 days of dosing 2g in the morning i now feel what can only be described as brain damaged. I can no longer form coherent sentences, my memory is, well, ruined! I also find it hard to concentrate on anything which i found alarming so i contacted ""Professor Douglas. J. Phillips"", the owner of CH who i found to be not helpful whatsoever. I mean this guy flat out denied any problems with his products which is a complete lie! He asked about my diet which is fine, i also abstain from drinking alcohol albeit i was a heavy drinker in the past, and had a brief history of Cocaine use but that was years ago. I admitted this to help with Phillip's personal assessment but he stopped playing doctor by then and didn't reply.

After doing a google search on this SOB i found some alarming results:

**""David Ira Minkoff, M.D., who testified on Phillips's behalf, also had serious trouble. On August 3, 2001, the Florida Board of Medicine fined him $10,000 and suspended his license for one year, to be followed by two years of probation [3]. Minkoff, a Scientologist, was implicated in the death of Lisa McPherson, a Scientologist who allegedly died of malnutrition while in the custody of other Scientologists. Documents in the case indicate that even though Minkoff had never met McPherson, he prescribed sedative medication by telephone to Church of Scientology staff members who had called on her behalf. Although admitting no guilt, Minkoff reached a $100,000 settlement in 1997 in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by McPherson's estate.""**

**In June 2010, Department of Health investigators came to Phillips' office as undercover patients.

I'm going for a blood test Monday and have been told to bring along the ""Piracetam"" so it can be tested. I have contacted the FDA who are very interested and also want me to send a sample. If there's any long term damage caused i'm not going to give up till this guy is finished!


Mr. Phillips also posts on http://brainmeta.com/forum/ under the pseudonym of ""GodConsciousness"", discrediting any bad experiences as companies merely trying to stain his already bad reputation. LOL! Not to mention his company sponsors the brainmeta forum (facepalm).

Yes, this is my fault and i agree i should have done more research before purchasing but if i can prevent this from happening to someone else i'll be happy.

Also for such a prestigious university, he fails to mention this on his Linked in profile shown here:

In no particular order: Some of the Supplements/Herbs/Nootropics I’ve tried over the years and my overall subjective summary of them:,384,d1ees4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d1ees4/in_no_particular_order_some_of_the/,133,1567994558.0,"**Noopept:** (10-40mg) intervals, once per day, every-so often: Odd headspace, sometimes feels like I can focus more, sometimes less, pretty unpredictable when it comes to cognition. Does something to my visual perception which is hard to describe (like my vision gets grainier but it seems my ability to visually focus is better?). Often get very minor headaches. Underwhelming and not useful imo. Very subtle. May experiment again because it wasn’t “bad” but didn’t seem beneficial in any way. Seems to last about 6-8hrs but it’s hard to gauge. Disclaimer: Lack of Long Term Rigorous Research

**Piracetam:** multi-gram dosage, once per day for a few weeks: Similar to noopept in the sense that something happens to my vision (like my vision gets grainier but it seems my ability to visually focus is better?), no real change in ability to focus etc. Underwhelming and not useful imo. Very subtle but probably placebo. Might experiment again because it wasn’t “bad” but didn’t seem beneficial in any way.

**Phenylpiracetam:** 100mg/day-200mg/day. Moderate to strong ability to help me focus on one activity to completion whether it be cognitive or physical exertion. Stimulation, but no euphoria, maybe a slight mood boost in a motivational way. Partially blunts emotions. Causes focus mode. May cause insomnia if taken too late. Seems to pair well with caffeine although you can overdo it, so sip the caffeine slowly. Disclaimer: Lack of Long Term Rigorous Research

**Coluracetam:** 25mg sublingual/day. Within 45 minutes my vision changes, there is what seems to be a sensitivity to light in an enjoyable way such that there is a very subtle halo about objects/colors. Aesthetic of color does seem to be enhanced. Causes good cognitive focus for about 4 hours. May cause stomach upset (dry heaving/vomiting) within 45 minutes of taking. Disclaimer: Research Chem.

**Phenibut:** 600mg. takes about 1-3 hours to kick in. Waves of relaxation, and uplifts mood in a non-euphoric way. Relaxation increases and peaks about 6 hrs. later. Sleep is very easy, very refreshing, dreams can be deep/vivid and lucid dreaming is promoted. In total lasts about 16-24 hours. There can be an after-glow which can feel very nice, like a mild body-high post-morning. Disclaimer: May cause headaches but uncommon (\~1/10 times), may cause constipation. May cause addiction/habit formation, may cause hangover.

**PRL-853:** 5-20mg dose. Strong numbing effect on oral mucosa. Changes in headspace, similar to noopept. Causes distinct grainy-resolution change in my vision, but it’s hard to tell if it’s better or worse. The effect seems very similar to noopept. Moderate feeling of focus. Lasts about 4 hours. Disclaimer: Research Chem.

**Tianeptine:** sodium at 8mg/dose, sulfate at 25-30mg/dose. Moderately opioid, definitively relaxing and mood stabilizing/uplifiting. Moderately addictive (especially sodium). Causes weak waves of wellbeing. Sodium lasts about 2-3hrs, sulfate lasts about 6hrs. Sulfate onset is smoother and lasts longer without sharp peak, sodium peak is stronger but dissipates faster. Causes increased food intake/hunger. If taken over the course of a few days, causes distinct type-pimples/carbuncles which are usually localized in the facial region \[researching this, I found that Amineptine (a similar tianeptine analogue) causes this side-effect\]. Taken only once a week at doses described for no discernable side-effects. Take more than dosage described and side-effects increase exponentially. May cause headaches (\~1/20th time) Best if taken at night. Disclaimer: opioid addiction, rapid tolerance when taken chronically, little research.

**Skullcap tincture** (Scutellaria baicalensis): (a few drops to a full dropper) Odd bodily sensations, dysphoria, stopped after second experience which was identical. Terrible ime. Will never do again.

**Hops tincture:** (2 dropper fulls) helps with peripheral relaxation but not so much cognitive. Makes me relaxed for about 2 hours but then have a rebound effect of a lot of energy, similar to my experience with alcohol (probably due to GABA agonism rebound)

**Glycine:** relaxing, helps with sleep at high dose (9.0g) at night but gives grogginess/lethargy post-awakening. Grogginess/lethargy attenuated with mixing with .7g proline + 1.0g taurine. Glycine has to be dosed high initially (3.0g), and then the other 6.0g glycine + .7g proline + 1.0g taurine in 1-2 cups of water, makes a nice semi-sweet relaxing pre-sleep drink. Very useful for relaxation/sleep in high dose

**Taurine:** 1.0g at night or in the morning. Relaxing but not to the same extent as glycine. Seems to help with stress. Helps with sleep. Does not on its own cause lethargy like glycine. Subtle but useful

**Proline:** 0.7g in conjunction with taurine and glycine due to its good synergy. Added this to glycine/taurine stack to mimic collagen since collagen has high proline-glycine content. See glycine post on dose mixtures.

**Melatonin:** for sleep, inconsistent, does not help overall ime

**Ashwaganda KSM-66:** 100-mg intervals. Apathy, amotivation, tendency for strong anxiolysis to the detriment of mood. Reduces motivation too much for my liking. Will never do again.

**Corydalis tincture** *(Corydalis yanhusuo)***:** containing tetrahydropalmatine: Makes me tried but is anxiogenic, causes visual distortions and random visual and auditory hallucinations, mostly in the form of closed eye rapidly-fluctuating visuals, dysphoria. Absolutely horrible ime. Lasts about 4 hours. Gives me a toxic feeling. Will likely never take again.

**Green Tea Extract (high ECGC content):** Dosed once a week for a few months: 1st time I did this I was straight euphoric/high, similar to cannabis, lasted 6 hours, I was totally conked out. After 1st time, made me very tired, and gave me a moderate body high, lasts about 5-6 hrs. Makes eyes heavy, makes body tired. Does not help with cognition, causes cognitive lethargy, although feels somewhat refreshing after use/experience. Consistent effects after 1st experience. Disclaimer: Green tea extract has been linked to liver disease/damage

**Sulbutiamine:** Gives energy, slightly euphoric, feels addictive, causes craving feelings. Has given me partial rash on random localized area of skin, generally in a vein-protruding region, but uncommon (\~1/20 incidence), but I have attributed to sulbutiamine so I rarely if ever use it anymore. Goes away within 30 min if symptom exists. Sometimes get headaches/stomach aches but they are minor. Lasts about 4 hours at 200mg/dose. Disclaimer: May be hepatotoxic long term, may cause kidney problems

edit: added disclaimer of kidney problems

**Uridine:** 50mg/day morning. Gives energy, feels like a mood-buffer. Antidepressant in my experience. Better when paired with choline source since the choline seems to be more cerebral and the uridine seems to promote the choline effect. Lasts about 4-6 hrs. Good for morning dosing. No noticeable side-effects ime.

**Choline in any form:** 200mg, clears up brain fog, very-very rarely 1/50 times may cause headache, but I think this is due to happen with limited hydration. Good for extending energy later on in the day rather than caffeine. Lasts about 3hrs. Great when paired with uridine in morning, without uridine later in the day. This is probably one of my favorite supplements due to its rapid onset of action, and its practical absence of side-effects. I've been currently using alpha-GPC due to getting it at discount a while back.

**Rhodiola tincture:** In my experience this works better than any powder salidroside/rosavin (although salidroside powder works ok). Gives a lot of energy, but has a high tolerance, have to cycle it every 3 days because it loses its effects. Side effects of use occur after 2nd day of use, include a kind of ocular accommodative dysfunction where it’s hard to focus (I forget the medical term) and eyes are like locked-forward. Energy is strong, but peripheral and somato rather than cerebral. May cause insomnia if taken too late into the day even by day 1. Excellent when mixed with caffeine source.

**Ephedra tincture:** Cardiac/peripheral energy. Way too much to my liking. Helps with decongestion. Highly bronchodilating and peripherally vasoconstricting. Makes you want to run!! Sympathomimetic effects highly sensitive/enhanced. Lasts \~2-3 hrs. Post-experience causes grogginess/lethargy. Too strong on circulatory system for my liking. Gives a similar eye-locked forward feeling with prolonged use of rhodiola. Disclaimer: May cause death/cardiac arrest

**Mucuna pruriens extract:** Definitely feels dopaminergic, but not euphoric, causes cognitive relaxation, causes hunger and I definitely have eaten more on it. Gives an odd head-space/dreamy-like but not euphoric in any way.

**Bromantane:** sublingual 35mg, still in my process of gauging effects. Lasts a long time, probably 16 hrs. Sleep is difficult but not impossible. It does feel like I was awake and didn’t sleep at all, but when I get up I feel refreshed/felt like I had enough relaxing which doesn’t seem to cause problems post-experience. Gives subtle energy boost, and seems to boost mood (has a minor glow-like effect, I think some people call this god-mode) and cognitive focus albeit in a mild-fashion. Disclaimer: Lack of Long Term Rigorous Research

**Nutmeg:** The powder at about 10grams (generally mixed with ice-cream) causes intoxication about 3-8 hrs later. The intoxication lasts about 32-48hrs. May cause some stomach discomfort/headaches. Variable on sleep, usually disturbs sleep but is relaxing/enjoyable enough ime that this isn’t an issue. Causes mydriasis, xerostomia (dry mouth) and ocular vasodilation (red eyes). You do not want to do this more than once per two weeks or it will cognitively slow-you (ime), similar to cannabis intoxication. The pure essential oil gives a smoother experience, without as much stomach discomfort/headaches although they do occur. Unlike the powder, the oil may cause esophageal irritation/inflammation in addition to oil burps (which are not appealing ime). 4-8 drops of oil in peanut butter/chocolate/Nutella. I do not recommend the oil, the powder is much stronger, lasts longer and is more enjoyable from my experience. YMMV. Some people absolutely hate this and makes them sick, but people I know say I have an iron stomach. Disclaimer: May be poisonous, death at high  dosage, may cause seizures

edit: Disclaimers due to unfounded information on hepatoxicity

**Kava extract** (high kavalactone content): Very subtle relaxation. May be enjoyable but is variable in my experience. Sometimes stomach discomfort. May help with sleep. Better taken as an afternoon-nighttime for relaxing effects. Disclaimer: May be hepatotoxic at high/chronic doses

**Adrafinil:** 125mg, immediately on wake-up with minimum two cups of liquid. Takes about 30 minutes to fully kick in. Strongly eugeroic (wakefulness promoting) and stimulating. Lasts about 10hrs. Focus/energy/antifatigue. I have felt a moderate body-high. Great for waking but excellent when sleep-deprived. Often causes constipation if not enough liquids drank throughout the day. Seems to require doubling the amount of liquids you consume throughout day to be effective/minimize side-effects. May cause minor headaches, stomach aches and constipation. Not recommended daily but cycled every other or every 3 days. Disclaimer: May cause insomnia (heptotoxicity has not truly been demonstrated)

edit: Disclaimers due to unfounded information on hepatoxicity

**Zembrin** (*Scletium tortuosum* extract\*)\***:** 25mg sublingual. Difficult to handle powder, extremely hygroscopic. Tastes salty, gives an interesting cerebral headspace. Seems to change vision slightly similar to racetams. Feels serotonergic, good for focus. Seems to stabilize mood although I’ve felt it blunts compassion and may cause mild aggression. Lasts about 6-8hrs. Gives a relatively clear headspace. May cause minor headaches although somewhat uncommon (\~1/10 times)

**Areca Catechu:** (chewed slices): Within a few minutes causes rapid relaxation of body and mind, uplifts mood, causes drowsiness and mild-euphoria, occasionally lower appendage (quadriceps) muscle spasms, increases oral mucus production. Lasts about 0.75-1hr. May cause minor headache after, may cause mouth irritation. Disclaimer: May cause cancer.

**Thunbergia laurifolia:** still experimenting, 350mg capsules, . 1st time with 700mg causes clear dopaminergic headspace similar to first time ECGC. Mild body high. Strong relaxation and sleep promoting. Rapid tolerance such that 4x dose needed to deliver similar effects, although after the 1st time, the mild body-high and relaxation is significantly reduced similar to EGCG. Lasts about 2-3hrs.

**Kratom:**  (split into Red/White) because I think these are the most distinct,  Green is closer to white, and Maeng da is closer to red without as much  pruritus

Red: 3-6 full tablespoons  in about 1-2 cups of tea (mint) with added sugar, sipped over the  course of 1 hour, generally in the morning. Slightly numbing to the  mouth, feel effects in about 20-30 minutes. Causes great initial feeling  of wellbeing/euphoria/antidepressant, significant perceptual increase  in temperature throughout and after experience. Wellbeing/euphoria  slowly peaks at about 1-2 hours and then smooths out to an ending of  total of 8 hours from start. Starts low but tends towards strong body  high/tactile pleasure throughout the experience. Mild feelings of  craving/addictive potential especially initially. Initial feeling is  sometimes angiogenic and very stimulating but it can also be anxiolytic  (less so on initial come up), followed (after a few hours) a feeling of  lethargy, heavy eyes, slight mydriasis and heroic pruritus\[itching\]  (depending on dosage). A lower dose is good for doing manual/physical  exertion that doesn't require too much cognition like working out or  working in a garden or running/jogging. Notable lapses in memory similar  to cannabis, limited attention span (exacerbates ability to focus). May  cause insomnia, sleep is almost impossible if taken too late in the  day, but you can stay in bed relaxed itching in ""body-high glory"". Red  seems to cause more pruritus than white or green or Maeng da. Erections  are possible, but orgasm is near impossible. Post-waking, there can be  residual pruritus, but often I perceive a beautiful body-after glow that  feels like my skin is refreshed. Opioid effects are \~8hrs, and  completely back to baseline about 24hrs after experience (meaning no  more pruritus/kratom-feelings). Tolerance rapidly increases similar to  traditional opiates. Not advised more than once a week due to addiction  potential and insomnia issues. Disclaimer: Addictive/habit forming.

White:  Same dose, same way as Red. Difference is that White is more  stimulating, peaks faster, and stays more stimulating than tending  towards relaxing throughout the experience. Less pruritus but still  significant. Tendency to be more anxiogenic than Red. White lasts about  2hrs less than red, so about 6 instead of 8hrs. Same as Red in the sense  that craving/addictive, partial mydriasis, notable lapses in memory  similar to cannabis, exacerbates ability to focus cognitively, good for  physical exercise, insomnia if taken too late, possible erections, near  to impossible orgasm etc...

Edit: Kratom- may cause jitters similar to caffeine, but I've found this is variable depending on batch

I've been taking lions mane mushroom for general brain fog for about 3 months now. The brain fog has gotten moderately better, but what I'm really noticing is a massive reduction in the tip of the tongue effect I was feeling. For those who don't know, thats a very minor form of aphasia where it can take a few seconds to come up with the right word. It wasn't why I started taking the lions mane, but it was something that bothered me. I just chalked that up to getting older. Honestly, It was a very subtle effect, because I only thought about it yesterday and said ""holy shit, that annoying thing has really reduced by at least 90% since I started taking this stuff."". I genuinely went from having that feeling at least one if not multiple times a day to maybe it happens once a week. 

I've read some reports online that lions mane is exceptionally useful for a lot of patients with brain damage that results in poor speech production.

"[A comprehensive guide] LSD and MDMA for permanent cognitive enhancement. The best ""nootropic"" is the ability to develop good habits.",365,5updzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5updzj/a_comprehensive_guide_lsd_and_mdma_for_permanent/,116,1487402169.0,"Cross-posted to r/drugs but I wrote this originally for you guys.

So there has been some interest in LSD after some posts about microdosing, and I have a lot of experience microdosing on and off as well as experience taking full doses of LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA for the sole purpose of self development.

If you haven't already read my previous post, I have an [LSD trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5ajwd6/this_was_the_most_meaningful_experience_of_my/) as well as my MDMA trip report that I [just posted on /r/Drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5utmoj/mdma_might_be_the_greatest_therapeutic_substance/).

Some things to consider. DOSAGE MATTERS. Effects do NOT follow a linear scale. In other words. 25mcg is not ""double"" the feeling of 12.5mcg. Also 50mcg is completely different than 100mcg. You could be jittery on one dose and totally focused on another.

---

**Objectives - LSD**

I've been obsessed with self development, so what drew me to psychedelics was a few things. 

* Psychedelics take your essence and allow you to observe it as though you were looking at yourself from the objective perspective of a completely different human being. You gain an insane hyperawareness into your thoughts and behaviors that would take months to truly understand otherwise. Even if you can logically deduce something for yourself in a sober state, psychedelics helps you ***internalize this logic in a significantly more effective way***.
* Psychedelics increases neurogenesis (see below)
* Psychedelics can help rewire synapses that feel extremely hard wired (ie. people often completely quit smoking the day after. Bad habits are significantly easier to understand and reform after the fact, etc)
* Psychedelics make you better appreciate the world around you, which in turn removes the pressure to perform and thus makes you perform better
* Psychedelics help you reform bad habits and put you on a good track towards developing new habits.

Here is an excerpt that summarizes psychedelic effects on neurogenesis:

>LSD does cause an increase in BDNF, and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. LSD can be described as polyamorious in that is binds to every single seratonin and dopamine receptor. To have a greater affect on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis you really want activation of the three rectptors mentioned earlier. This is where psilocybin enters the conversation. Psilocybin has greater affinity for the three sites mentioned, and the effect of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity is also greater, because of the selectivity of psilocybin. 

So why LSD over Mushrooms even though mushrooms have an arguably greater effect on neurogenesis? The short answer is control. Shrooms are like a magical train ride into the alien depths of your brain. It could be a good time, it could be a bad time, but once you board there's no getting off. A good trip sitter can help adjust the tracks and get you through a ""bad experience"", but you can't really will yourself into a different mindset as easily.

If you really want to get a scientific understanding of LSD and its effects, please read Dr. Fadiman's book. It has tons of objective studies, quantitative data, etc that backs up the aforementioned bullet points. I'm not going to do your homework for you so take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research if what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you. There are dozens of studies out there.

Now to be clear, the chance of having a bad trip on shrooms with a good trip sitter is more rare than you think, and a lot of people say that their ""bad trips"" were incredibly insightful and ultimately productive nonetheless, but some people can't handle the unknown, so it's important to know yourself. Regardless, you will come out of the other side with new insights and what you do with them is up to you.

*TL;DR:* The objective for me was to better understand my flaws and work to overcome the bottlenecks in my own personality to become a better, more intelligent, and more efficient person in my pursuit of self development.


---

**Objectives - MDMA**

At first I wasn't very interested in MDMA, but after doing it I realized it's absolutely incredible in ways that LSD could NEVER be.

* MDMA works on the parts of your brain that regulate fear, empathy, trust, and openness
* MDMA is in the final stages of FDA approval
* MDMA allows you to take the most traumatizing memories of your life and come to terms with them in ways that would take months or years with traditional therapy alone
* MDMA can help you understand and overcome the paralyzing fears of failure, self-doubt, and personal rigidity

---

**Giving my friends LSD/MDMA in therapeutic sessions**

After experiencing all this myself I truly wanted to share it with everyone I knew. I carefully reached out to friends I knew who had major to minor issues with personality, relationships, etc and took them through my protocol.

* One friend went from smoking 1 pack of cigarettes every 2 days to smoking 1 pack every 2 weeks. If she had a little more self control in general i'm certain she could give it up entirely. She was also able to realize that she was in a toxic relationship and leave her crazy bf after realizing some important things during her trip. She also expressed a new appreciation for nature after walking in the park during her trip.
* Another friend who took 250mcg of LSD told me she suddenly realized that the source of her anger had been her father all along, who had left her and her siblings when she was young. She thought that she had come to terms with this but the LSD made her realize it was still deep within her mind and causing her to be constantly angry. It's been more than a month since her trip and she has expressed that she rarely ever gets angry. She also told me that she sees ""through"" people and has extraordinary insight into manipulative behavior whereas before she would take things at face value. She's been able to register for classes after a long hiatus due to her feeling uncertain about her life. She has a lot more confidence now
* Another friend who had severe self-esteem issues due to his constantly disparaging wife realized his self worth and was able to overcome his paralyzing self-deprecation. He is now studying for a certification to go back to work on a subject he's always been passionate about but too afraid to pursue due to his own mental obstacles.
* My best friend and her husband took MDMA and resolved some of the biggest barriers in their relationship practically overnight. Both of them were able to talk so freely about what was on their mind while simultaneously accepting each other that it literally made all their arguments seem petty and moot. Their relationship is still significantly more open and stronger, 4 wees after the fact. They understand each other better and feel like there's more empathy in the relationship.

Why do I do this? There is nothing more fulfilling to me than seeing people ***reach their fullest potential***. It's a beautiful thing and I love trip sitting.

**Who I am on a microdose**

Microdosing is great because it's subtle enough that no one would notice except you. When I microdose I'm more amped about life, about the task at hand, and have a noticeable improvement in drive and motivation to get shit done. I've realized that I'm more creative; I have better ideas, and my ideas are more fluid and less traditional, I'm appreciably more witty, social, and more of a badass. This is all really subjective but after months of microdosing I am pretty certain I can distinguish the effects that are unique to LSD here. Though I'm typically very introverted and basically glued to my computer at home most of the day, on a microdose I can effortlessly decide to go out, check out events, or decide to do something social that otherwise would take a lot of mental energy.

It's important to know that even on a microdose, *you're still the captain of your own ship and are responsible for the outcome*. It's way easier to have a good time and work towards developing good habits on a microdose, but it's not quick fix where you pop an 1/8th tab and wait for magic to happen. It is merely a catalyst for great things, and microdosing every 3 days will help you build upon smaller successes.

The purpose of microdosing is to put your mind in a ""learning state"" that makes new habits more ""sticky"". And by consistently microdosing and practicing something the stickiness will build up and the habit will remain with you more strongly.

**Permanent Outcomes**

I would dare to say that the human being I am now is incredibly different than who I was 4 months ago when I started everything. I'm significantly more aware, more straightforward with people, daring, open, creative, and I definitely give no effs compared to before. I work and I do what I think I need to do without worrying about the outcome as much. I ***completely*** know who I am now, inside and out. I've come to terms with my weaknesses as a person, accepted them, and am learning how to work around them to get what I want. Other weaknesses I've gotten rid of completely. I know why I used to be avoidant, I know why I treated people certain way, and I know what I need to do to shatter my personal boundaries. I'm still a work in progress but the path is clear now, and I'm excited at the opportunity to challenge myself further.

**Eterneraki's Protocol for getting the best out of LSD & MDMA**

I think it's absolutely imperative to do both eventually. They are like yin and yang. LSD takes a scattered room and helps you gain insight from seemingly unrelated thoughts. MDMA makes you accept the things you've had difficulty accepting and makes you realize that things aren't nearly as big of a deal as you once thought. Just fucking go for it.

If you have anger or anxiety issues I recommend MDMA FIRST. Then a week or 2 later you can do LSD.

Prior to either MDMA or LSD take a week to do the following:

* Practice mindfulness meditation (headspace is a great app) for at least 10 minutes every day
* Take 5-10 minutes every night and write a journal entry. Personal reflections, examine your mood and start thinking about what you want to accomplish during your trip
* Start preparing a list of at least 5 questions you would want to ask yourself during the trip. Some questions may include ""What holds me back from X?"" ""Why is my relationship with this person X?"" ""what do I like about myself?"" ""Why am I afraid/worried/etc about X?"" The more specific the better, but general questions are better than no questions
* Clear out the ENTIRE day that you will be tripping. On the day of, silence your phone and get it out of the way. Your trip sitter should ask you the questions you've prepared right after your peak (~4 hours in).
* Journal the night after your trip as well as the next day or 2 afterwards

MDMA Protocol is 100mg (up to 120 if you're on the heavy side), then 60-75mg 2 hours after the first dose. This is basically the same as the MAPS therapy program. Trip will last 4-6 hours

* Mix the powder in a drink (powder is really bitter, juice is better than water). DO NOT CHUG IT or you will feel nauseous when it all hits you at once. Take sips here and there and finish it over a 3-5 minute span of time. Make sure you eat a light meal 2 hours before. Anything more will either delay onset or reduce effects.

LSD Protocol is 150mcg preferably in the morning (the earlier the better). Trip will last 6-8 hours and you will be tired as fuck. 

In both scenarios it's important to be with someone (SOBER) who cares about you.

AFTERWARDS - This is when the real work begins. Take your new insights and realizations and make a plan to practice being a better you. If you want to microdose take 12.5mcg every third day in the morning. You may do this for 10 weeks straight. Microdosing is safe and very few (if any) adverse events have been noticed by the vast majority of people. Continue reflecting, meditating, and documenting your progress. A support system is tremendously helpful.

**Where to buy - precursor vs actual drug**

/r/darknetmarkets

I personally buy from ""pushing taboo"" (look it up)

precursor lsd as far as I know is just as potent/useful. It's a little more expensive though so I prefer to just buy LSD straight up.

---

**Abuse**

Both can be abused but MDMA is significantly easier to abuse. Newbies can take MDMA again a few weeks after the first, but the recommendation is at least 6 weeks. If you've taken MDMA twice in 2 months, you should wait 3 months before your next roll. 4 times a year thereafter is optimal. Any more than that and you risk falling into the abyss (and it's not fun from what I heard).

LSD is so exhausting that you probably will never want to touch the stuff again, but some people still manage to abuse it. 1 full trip every 6 months is more than enough.

Don't be a fucking idiot.

---

**Safety**

[This graph is a good tl;dr](http://imgur.com/KV6TdKM) 
(Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs)

I'm pretty exhausted from writing all of this out but there are numerous studies on the safety profile of LSD, MDMA, and shrooms. They're completely safe when not abused. Be aware of potential drug interactions if you're on SSRIs or something else.

Almost every single experience with every nootropic anyone's done on this board is confounded by either coadministration with caffeine or adaptation to caffeine.,362,f2f493,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/f2f493/almost_every_single_experience_with_every/,128,1581484286.0,"How many people here abstain from caffeine totally? How many people have experimented with most of the nootropics they use, exclusively, after at least 2 months *total* sobriety from caffeine? Maybe it doesn't affect the results... but maybe it does... 


And before anyone says ""it's just a little adenosine blocking,""... caffeine affects dopamine, serotonin, gaba, cortisol, thyroid, brainwave state, and many other factors, not just adenosine (adenosine has multiple downstream influences, regardless). Also can change sleep architecture which would impact baseline physiology the next day. If you ever look into the effects of caffeine it's a pharmacological rabbithole, and it's not simple. Not to mention all the compounds in coffee (MAOIs?) and/or tea that are confounding variables. Think about it. 

What if that piracetam you took that wasn't that great had something to do with the coffee you drink daily? And if you tried piracetam 'without caffeine,' did you wait a few weeks with no caffeine, or did you just try piracetam during the state of mild caffeine withdrawal and upregulation/resensitization, also not giving you a clear picture of its effects?

So this thread is a bit of a call out, something I normally wouldn't do but feel it needs to be done. The current top thread in this subreddit is someone's reviews of the bunch of nootropics they've done which I think is great, we should all try to share as much info as possible to help others here. 

What is unfortunate though is that this review has mentioned nearly nothing of the cognitive enhancements offered by these substances and instead focused on the depression/anxiety/drug addiction benefits of them. That's not a bad thing to learn about these side benefits but we now have a bunch of people that are self-diagnosing and medicating with nootropics then saying which nootropics are bad because they didn't cure their depression or anxiety, rather than reviewing the nootropic effect of the substances. 

These people then take double, triple or ten times the recommended dose trying to get results, stacking multiple nootropics at a time and then creating shitpost after shitpost, all getting deleted, until eventually they've reviewed 33 substances in about 3 months time. 

I remembered seeing this account post months ago and having their posts deleted multiple times from mods because they had just jumped into taking shit tons of Ashwagandha and complaining it didn't treat their depression and was unsafe for people or how they were feeling unwell because of taking multiple nootropics. They were posting about a new nootropic they were on nearly every day with no benefits and a bunch of sides, eyes twitching, mood swings etc.

Because they only mentioned 1 of 33 substances offered cognitive benefits I asked them provide some more info about the nootropic effects of their reviews:

>Dude, you have no idea what a nootropic even is. It's just an unregulated substance with a benefit to the brain. You don't understand how any of this works. 

This individual came to nootropics after a kratom addiction (congratulations beating that by the way) and has since done about 5+ years of nootropics testing in the space of 3 months in attempts to cure depression/anxiety. They might have some useful experiences to share but this is an extremely dangerous strategy that doesn't properly test the effectiveness of any one substance, essentially averaging about 3 days each substance and spending the whole time comparing them to stimulants. 

I guess the purpose of my post here is to make sure you understand what the purpose of a nootropic is (cognitive enhancement not anti-depressant, anxiety cure although some may help) and that you shouldn't trust reviews just because someone has done a lot of nootropics, instead looking at the quality of their testing parameters.",2020-03-30 17:48:42

Summary:

Antibiotics strong enough to kill off gut bacteria can also stop the growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus, a section of the brain associated with memory, reports a new study in mice. Researchers also uncovered a clue to why -- a type of white blood cell seems to act as a communicator between the brain, the immune system, and the gut.

I've drank tea and coffee since about 10 years old, but it took me another 25 years to discover its detrimental effects on me. 20 minutes in, after consumption, I'm buzzing (usually from coffee), have great energy, great mood, chatty as hell, can be funny as F! and feel euphoric. 2-3 of hours later the effects subside and I feel subdued, sometimes twitchy. If I have another caffeine hit at this point it's not the same intensity as the first and then here is the real kicker: \~24 hours later I'd often get migraines, horrible irritability, become impatient and snappy and overall feeling out of sorts for hours. Where I'd had multiple caffeine hits throughout the previous day this would ensure that the negative symptoms continued longer into the next day feeling out of control. I went decaf about 7 years ago - never really looked back - I still get some benefits without the caffeine! It was a MAJOR significance to eliminating some of my ADHD symptoms (impulsive, overly chatty, erratic behaviour, etc.) . Very occasionally, when I go on a night out, I might have a Red Bull and Vodka and can really be the life of the party at the time, but the next day or after my mood is rarely good!

**Gluten/Wheat:** 6 years ago I started an elimination diet - I basically lived on rice & peas and drank water for about a month. First 3-5 days it was hellish; headaches would pain me terribly, but after I noticed a ***significant*** positive in my mood and my energy levels. Whereas before I would struggle to wake up in the mornings, hit fatigue each day around the afternoon and have brain fog throughout the day, I now felt amazing and had none of these symptoms. It was like a cloud had cleared in my head, I was no longer tired and was able to think clearly. I was peeing more often too, like every two hours to begin with because wheat/gluten retains water. I introduced different foods over the next few weeks and noticed that whenever I ate wheat based products the fatigue and brain fog would return and this would affect me for days after. I'm not Celiac or diagnosed as gluten intolerant (I have no other negative side effects with gluten). I've been gluten free since then and this has been important in helping me manage my ADHD symptoms.

**Sugar:** I cut this out when I went Gluten free - an overall positive when reduced.  I can tell when I've had too much but I'm a real sucker with a sweet tooth!

**Zinc (Gluconate) 40mg:** When I notice that I'm beginning to procrastinate and become less motivated to start tasks I take a Zinc supplement. I don't really notice any difference the first day but after about 18-24 hours I'm back on it. I wake up feeling more motivated to start tasks, a little less impulsive and more intent in my focus. I actually stumbled across this discovery by accident some 15 years ago (before I knew my symptoms correlated with ADHD) while battling a lifetime of large reoccurring and painful canker sores/mouth ulcers. It stopped them and at the time I noticed some positive changes in my energy/motivation. It wasn't for another 8 years or so that I realised the significance that Zinc had on alleviating my ADHD symptoms. I don't supplement zinc on a daily basis - only when I feel the need.

**Vitamin D3 (5000 ui):** Imagine being out in the lovely sunshine all day, getting a slight tan, and by bedtime you hit the pillow feeling good, fall asleep and sleep soundly then wake up feeling fresh and early the next day. That's what Vitamin D3 does for me. Doesn't seem to have any effect on my moods or focus, just seems to make me feel fresher, brighter - better. I supplement more in the winter (during the shorter/darker days) but only for a few weeks at a time.

**L-Tyrosine 500mg:** L-Tyrosine is another positive for me - within 30 minutes of taking it I feel the effects of being more on track and focused. This amino acid has been great for me when I know I will need to focus and get things done - like a work project. A side effect I have found is that my sleep tends to be better and I dream a lot more. I don't supplement daily - only when I feel the need and sometimes suffer headaches from it if taken for too many days.

**Magnesium (complex) 400mg:** It has a minimal effect on my moods - maybe slightly calming. I sometimes take it to chill me out before bed to aid my sleep. It has the side effect of making me poop more. I don't supplement daily - only when I feel the need.

**5-HTP (100mg):** Has a big effect on my sleep - I hit the pillow and fall asleep pretty quick if taken a few hours before bed. It gives me the best/craziest dreams. I definitely feel something good with this, it's not negative for me but I cannot quite put my finger on it. Overall it has a positive outcome on my mood. I rarely take this supplement though due to the risk of serotonin syndrome and usually only take it to balance out the dopamine if taking L-Tyrosine.

**Cetirizine Hydrochloride/ZIRTEK (Hayfever/Allergy relief):** Here's an odd discovery I made. I've always suffered with cat and hayfever allergies and sometimes take Cetirizine to combat them. Within a couple of hours of taking (I only take half a tablet/5mg) it makes me tired and I'll sleep right through the night (ZONKED!)  - the next morning i'm feeling slightly groggy (that's the downside) but then something strange/special happens, 12-24 after taking. I get this no-nonsense attitude and feeling of focused, become quite assertive and won't tolerate pettiness, but not in an aggressive manner. To sum up how I feel on this would be: ***""I know what needs to be done and this is how it's best to do it. Get to your point please. Come on, lets start and get on with the task!""***. I love the feeling I get from this the day after taking it. I don't like to take this to control my mood though as there are some not great documented side effects/reports that I'm not comfortable with. I don't supplement this often - only when REALLY needed.

**Food Colourings**

**Brilliant Blue (E133)** **~~& Sunset Yellow (Tartrazine E102)~~****:**

Okay, I avoid these two like the plague. Banned and previously banned in some European countries respectively. If I consume ~~either of these~~ E133 (Brilliant Blue) I start glowing, bounce off the walls and need to run around in circles within 15 minutes of consumption. It's not good that an additive, used in kid targeted foods, has this kind of effect in my opinion. The  warnings are there to be found for these two on the internet.

I am writing to you to express my opposition to HR 2851, the SITSA Act. As a lifelong (insert state here), I embrace a healthy and active lifestyle like many of our neighbors. I have followed the news in recent years as there has been a substantial increase in overdose deaths across our country - half of these deaths each year are attributed to illicit substances, with fentanyl and fentanyl analogues contributing to a larger percent of the share year over year. Legal pharmaceutical drugs account for approximately half of these overdose deaths each year.

Further legislation regarding fentanyl is redundant, as legislation has already accomplished what the SITSA Act is intended for. The Federal Analogue Act passed in 1986 gave authority to prosecutors to treat synthetic analogues the same as the drugs they resemble. In November 2017, the DEA passed emergency scheduling for all fentanyl analogues.

I believe the SITSA Act is an unnecessary overreach by our government. It consolidates all scheduling powers with our Attorney General - without consulting physicians, scientists, or public health experts. With this act, scheduling of a substance would become a subjective rather than an objective process. Harmless, legal supplements that people use everyday for health and wellness can be included under the scope of having similar effects to illicit substances, not based on chemical structure, pharmacology, dependence, or physiological effects on the body. If the goal is to enforce criminal penalties against fentanyl analogues, prosecutors already have the necessary tools to prosecute fentanyl analogues.

Please vote no HR 2851!

Thank you for your time.

I’ve been using different supps/noots for years, browsing this sub for years, spending thousands and thousands of dollars (as a guy in his 20’s nonetheless). It seems like a lot of us are trying to self medicate. For me, depression and anxiety is what I’m trying to conquer and I turned to supps and noots for that. Years of my time and money to find mild temporary relief. 

I constantly see different hypothesis being posted here. NAC breaking down the BBB, Nitric Oxide being neurotoxic, and countless more. Every single day it’s something new. It’s great to be curious and question things but there’s so much wild speculation here that I feel like it’s easy to walk away with wrong information. 

I understand there’s people here with conditions like TBI that may or may not actually see some benefit but I can’t help but feel the vast majority of us are just spinning our wheels and getting caught in this cycle of different substances. I can’t help but feel many of us are self medicating and looking for a cure that doesn’t exist here but we still come because maybe we’ll finally find that one thing to fix us.

I know this isn’t everyone. I understand there’s a lot of really knowledge people here but as much as it sucks to hear, sometimes the most effective things are the basics we hate to hear about. Sometimes the basics aren’t enough but how much are we really doing for ourselves here? Are throwing these different substances into our bodies doing more harm than good?

"The idiots guide to /r/nootropics (Too long, so extra post in the comments)",320,2yd2p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2yd2p5/the_idiots_guide_to_rnootropics_too_long_so_extra/,52,1425871780.0,"Hey!

Welcome to /r/nootropics, a subreddit that focuses on enhancing the brain through different methods (pills, exercise, meditation, anything). We'll hopefully be able to help you with your problems and get the extra edge you're most likely looking for. 

So first some background, it all started with Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea 40-50 years ago (it didn't really, but the history is easier this way). In the 60's Dr. Giurgea first synthesised piracetam, the now well known drug. For almost a decade he must have thought ""Hmm, how can I become more famous, make up a new word and start a new class of drugs?"" and then it finally hit him! If he made up a new word, added some criterias and then published it, he had it all figured out! So in 1972 he published a study that first used the word nootropic (which means to bend the mind) and decided on some criterias. The criterias are:

1.    They should enhance learning and memory.
2.    They should enhance the resistance of learned behaviors/memories to conditions which tend to disrupt them (e.g. electroconvulsive shock, hypoxia).
3.    They should protect the brain against various physical or chemical injuries (e.g. barbiturates, scopalamine).
4.    They should increase the efficacy of the tonic cortical/subcortical control mechanisms.
5.    They should lack the usual pharmacology of other psychotropic drugs (e.g. sedation, motor stimulation) and possess very few side effects and extremely low toxicity.

To make it easier for you, most people don't use this definition, ""nootropics"" is commonly used as ""cognitive enhancers"" (which might be neurotoxic, have serious sides, etc). I would like for everyone to stop doing this, but it will obviously not happen but please try. 

The real history goes way back. Humans have always been trying to improve their wetware, Ayurvedic, Shamanism, Chinese, Korean, Siddha, Tibetian, etc have all had herbs and the like to enhance cognition in some ways. That's all I'll say, I know way too little about it. 

You've now decided to start on your noot (short for nootropic) and improvement journey, great! We're glad to have you! But first of all I want to give you realistic expectations. Most noots will not be super noticable or enhance any brain function by a lot, we're just not there yet. Some drugs that seem insanly good in animal models do not transfer to humans at all. Then we have the problem with noots that you do not feel, but still ""works"" (an example for me would be [LLLT](http://www.gwern.net/LLLT)). But as always, people do not respond identically to drugs, you need to try things to know for sure. If you want to feel something you will most likely need to try stimulants or potentially an anxiolytic if you've got anxiety. Also be cautious of interactions, search and read lots before you add new things.

So now that you realise that noots aren't anything like NZT-48 in the movie Limitless we can move on. 


Before you start supplementing things you should get your lifestyle in order. The first thing you should take care of is your sleep. Try to get your +-8 hours and enhance the quality. When you got that in order you should start exercising, both cardiovascular (which got a lot proof for being a cognitive enhancer) and strength (not as much evidence, but more is coming). Try to be active during the day (try not to sit all day, exercise for one hour and think you're good), it'll help sleep and everything in your life. When you're done with those two things you have a good foundation, but adding meditation will help even more. It'll help with any anxiety you have, make you happier and a lot more (cognitive enhancing things). If you don't want to try meditation for some reason, look into neurofeedback. If you do not know how to fix these things, check /r/fitness, /r/meditation and /r/sleep, just check our sidebar relevant subreddits. 

When you got that fixed you could look into your diet. This part is super controversial due to different schools of thought. First we have the more mainstream, low GI-carbs, lots of ""good"" fats, lowish saturated, etc. But we also got a bit of the opposite (/r/keto), low carb, high fat (any except for transfats), etc. This forces the body to go into ketosis (your cells run on more ketones (except for a few cells)) which might hold some benefit for different populations. There's some research hinting towards being in ketosis might be good if you have blood sugar issues (which might cause alzheimer's later in life and cell damage all through), but to me, it does not seem to hold more promise than that. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me on this, but you need to make up your own mind and do what you want and find practical. Something almost everyone seems to agree on is that veggies and fruits (ketoers does not like the last one as much as veggies), this is backed up by a lot of research. This is due to multiple things, one of which is that veggies and fruits contain a lot of polyphenols with unique effects. Broccoli has been shown to reduce the effects of (some aspects of) autism, blueberries have shown to fight alzheimer's, etc. 

There's also a bunch of supplements that are usually not seen as noots but still have positive effects. The first group would be vitamins. There are a few that most people are deficent in, mainly vitamin K and D. Vitamin K (in the form of K1) is usually just found in leafy greens and K2 (which we usually prefer to supplement) in a few fermented foods. The health effects are quite important for preventing cardiovascular, bone and potentially neurological problems. Vitamin D has in recent years been promoted as the cure all, which it's obviously not. It is however very good for you. There are a lot of correlations between auto-immune diseases and higher mortality in vitamin D deficent people. Adding 2000-5000 IU of D3 daily (and keeping your blood levels checked) should fix the deficency for most people. 

If we move within the group micronutrients, but don't look at vitamins, we find minerals. The most significant in this category (relevant to us) is magnesium. To describe it in simple terms, it helps you calm down, promotes synaptic plasticity, help depression, long-term memory and a gazallion other things related to enzymes. If you take it before sleep you'll get better sleep quality and fall asleep faster. There are however forms that have been shown to be fairly worthless, mainly magnesium oxide. You will have to look up what form you want to supplement with. Just be sure to not take too high doses, it might act as a laxative!

Another mineral worth checking out is zinc. Deficency might lower testosterone and BDNF levels, both which are highly correlated with depression and cognitive functions. Doing too much might have opposite effects on BDNF levels and be toxic, so try to not overdo it. A normal starting dose would be around 15-25 mg, adding copper at other times might also be worth looking into. 

If we leave the micronutrients and look into other supplements that are worth looking into, we quickly find creatine. /u/silverhydra calls it a pseudovitamin (because real defiency results in retardation) which means we must look into it! Creatine is a molecule with a phosphate group bound to itself, if you remember your high school biology you'll remember that ATP becomes ADP and needs a new phosphate group to become ATP again. Guess where you can get that group from? Exactly, creatine! When your cells use up ATP your creatine phosphate donates its group and regenerates ATP. This has been found to be extra effective for vegetarians who consume small quantities of creatine. They are one of the few groups that actually might get an IQ increase from adding it! Other groups that would benefit from it would be elders, sleep deprived and potentially everyone else. It's neuroprotective, might raise your IQ, might make you live longer, modulates a billion things, there's really no reason not to take it. 

You've probably browsed multiple sites for starting your stack and then found /r/nootropics, so you want us to help you get started. Sure can do! There are four beginner stacks usually mentioned, the caffeine + theanine, noopept, bacopa and the piracetam (+ choline).

But something important before you order ANYTHING, get a damn milligram scale! As you're most likely not doing anything that requires exact measurements, something cheap like Gemini-20  will work. It will run you about $20 and will last you a very long time. This is for your own safety only (and I know you'll get hate/no help if you create a thread asking about what 200 mg looks like in powder form). Be also cautious with what source you use. Scammers pop up all the time in the noot world, some selling things that have caused hospitalisation. Check the sidebar for suppliers that are trusted, a guideline is to mainly buy from sellers than can provide third part CoAs (Certificate of Analysis). 

Have you heard about theanine before? If you have, it has probably been in the context of tea. If you have not, theanine is an amino acid analogue that we mainly find in tea. Why are we adding it to our lovely caffeine? Theanine seems to induce a state of calm, but still keep you alert/awake. Adding caffeine to it boosts the alert/awake, thus making the caffeine nicer for you. There are multiple studies on the combo with positive results (and on the individual compounds). If you're already drinking coffee you can pour some theanine in your cup and enjoy it more. The commonly recommended ratio between theanine and caffeine is 2:1 T:C. But be sure to play around with the ratio to see what works best for you. A good starting dose would be 50-100 mg caffeine and 100-200 mg theanine. 


Maybe you don't want to use caffeine, you want to expand your stack or have some other reason to add other things. Then you might want to start with piracetam and choline.  This stack has less scientific, but a fair amount of anecdotal evidence (if you care about that). Piracetam was first synthesised by Dr. Giurgea and his team and had some success. The mechanism is not fully understod yet (as with many other drugs) and some argue it's mainly good for the older population, fighting off the age related decline in brain function. The choline is added because one of the mechanisms seems to be cholinergic (the scientific evidence for adding it is weak, anecdotal is not as weak, but still not that strong). When you're adding choline you should be mind the dose. Too high dosages seem to induce depression in a lot of people. The dosage here is a bit more spread between users. Piracetam is taken in doses between 800-4800 mg, 1-3 times a day and choline is taken at doses around 200-1000 mg depending on form. You should however not buy any form of choline, there are better and worse sources. The worst source is choline bitartrate, which should be the last waw out (get some other form if you can). The better forms are Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline. You should try with and without choline to make sure how you respond to them. Try adding them one at a time, as you should with any supplement. 

Maybe you don't like the former ones, maybe want to try new things or maybe have some interest Russian drugs. Then you might be interested in noopept, a dipeptide. The evidence is even less for noopept, basically zero in humans in the western world. The mechanism for this one is even less researched. The doses for this compound is 5-30 mg 1-3x daily, orally or sublingual. Too high doses seem to impair working memory for some people, so it's best to start low. One of the creators have been interview by Smart Drug Smarts which you can listen to [here](http://smartdrugsmarts.com/rita-ostrovskaya-noopept/). 

Maybe you're one of those people who prefer to take ""natural"" things, then we have a herb for you! The herb I'm talking about is the adaptogenic herb Bacopa Monnieri. Bacopa has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for many years, but as with the other drugs, the mechanism is still not fully understod. The dose used is usually 300-500 mg if it's 50% bacosides. Don't get sad if you don't notice any effects right away, it takes time for it to work. Most trials with good results take it for weeks, it's usually recommended to be taken for atleast 8 weeks, then people usually start noticing it. 

There are lots of pre-made stacks, but almost all of them have the same problem, under dosed/don't tell the dose, over priced and no proof that the things they use are pure. So research A LOT before buying them.


As I've written before, there are non-supplemental ways to enhance your cognition. Remember the thing I talked about when I said it was important to measure things? It was LLLT, also called Low-Level Laser/LED/Light Therapy. It sounds like something a hippie made up, but there is a lot of evidence behind it. LLLT works by using a light source (in the 600-1000 nm range) and shining it where you want (in my case the skull (for the brain)). The photons are absorbed by cytochrome C which increases its activity and thus increase ATP production. It does a whole lot more related to it and has been shown to improve reaction time, improve memory, etc. For more info you should search this subreddit and get over to lostfalco's thread on longecity. Another thing that is a bit more risk would be tDCS, transcranial direct current stimulation. Exactly how and how good it works is fairly unknown, but preliminary data hints at some great results. If you want a high quality unit you will need to spend a few hundred bucks, if you can build one you'll save a lot. There's really no way to explain this without going overboard (placement, intensity, hormones and a lot of other things plays a role in the effect), so head over to /r/tDCS if you're interested. 

There are also other ways that just requires your computer, so called brain games! The current brain game that has most evidence is n-back. To keep it short a few studies has shown that it increases working memory and potentially IQ (which is disputed), it's one of the few games that have evidence behind it. The most common form is dual-n-back, where you are keeping track of a sound and a position. If you want to learn more, /u/gwern has by far the best papers on it which you can read [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ) and [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis).

This is also a good way to keep measuring how effective some of your noots are. Other brain games have not shown as much potential, but can be a way to measure progress. Sites that offers these are [Luminosity](http://www.lumosity.com/ ) (Paid) and [Cambridge Brain Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/ ) (Free), simple apps for reaction time are also worth looking at.

From the text:

Two patients were taking ashwagandha to decrease anxiety, one to counteract stress, one to increase concentration and one for increased energy and vitality. In the three cases from Iceland the patients were taking ashwagandha supplements from the same manufacturer (NOW® Ashwagandha) although one patient was also using another supplement that contained ashwagandha (Infowarslife® Super Male Vitality). In these three cases from Iceland the daily dose varied from 450 to 1350 mg. The implicated product was available for one of the US cases: Nature's Way®, Standardized Ashwagandha, containing 500 mg of ashwagandha Chemical analysis confirmed the presence of ashwagandha in all supplements, and no other known toxic compounds or trace metals were found. No patient was taking other potentially hepatotoxic prescription medications, although four were consuming one or more other supplements: Super Male Vitality, Spirulina, Chlorella, Rhodiola and Cerenity.

[After reading through the comments on my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/630czc/guide_to_healing_your_gut/), I got the impression that a lot of you thought the supplement regimen was too much and didn't like the idea of pounding a bunch of capsules every few hours(which I totally understand, but sometimes depression, anxiety, and IBS can make you desperate enough to do so). My intention with the post was to help people who need an overall solution to an incredibly stubborn problem, and attack it from all angles. While it might seem like overkill to some folks, I think we forget how persistent and relentless an IBS problem can be, and I believe its primarily due to the gut mucosal layer and intestinal microvillus not being there to keep the flora intact, typically as a result of bad diet. While I still think there quite a bit value in taking all these supplements together, I don’t think it is required for long term use if you eat properly after starting it. Once you get the gut back to being completely healthy and diverse with the proper flora, it goes back to what it was like when you were a kid; eating a poptart and a pepsi for breakfast everyday and shitting just fine. Not saying you should do that, but having good gut health allows you to have some fun sometimes and not worry the next day. That’s a really valuable thing, at least it is for me. 

**Probiotics**

One of the primary reasons why I suggested the GOL(34 Strain 100+ billion CFU) probiotic was because of the amount of strain variety you get. While there may be negligible amounts of some of the latter strains, with the proper prebiotic fiber, they can still flourish and populate your gut effectively with many different cognitively beneficial strains of bacteria that aren't as available in food(not to mention how gross some fermented food is). With Probotic drinks or foods, you often don't get as much variety and nor do you get the exact details of which strains are populated within. Kefir tends to produce a lot of the Lactobacillus strains that can exacerbate histamine issues, and thus allergies/inflammation. Kombucha's bacteria profile has some bad strains like Candida which can often make high sugar/fructose diet floras much worse, as candida loves it sugar... In its entirety, its great stuff that everyone should be drinking IN ADDITION to probiotic supplementation (but not at the exact same time - probiotic in the morning/kombucha at night). Considering that, it's incredibly hard to get a diverse microflora when just relying on food. You'd need to consume all kinds of things such as Kefir, Natto, Kimchi, Sauerkraut, Kombucha, Greek Yogurt, and a handful of others. Personally, I'd rather just take a high strain/CFU probiotic daily and consume those other probiotics sources a few times a week. We want to cover all the bases right? Flora diversity, intestinal mucosa, and microvillus health are all dependent on each other – we need gut homeostasis and equilibrium if we want the cognitive benefits too. 

**Intestinal and Mental Health**

As some of you may know, the ""leaky gut"" label has gotten a bit of criticism as of late for its overuse with Naturopaths and other pseudoscience based health advisers. While I still think there is a massive amount of research to be done to confirm its validity, it's safe to say that there are strong correlations between gutflora/intestinal health and all kinds of life debilitating neurological disorders. This is an emerging science that I believe is on the brink of changing how we look at healthcare. There is a second brain in our body, and what you feed that brain has profound effects on your overall health and equally your perception of reality. What happened to the old saying ""you are what you eat""? If you consume a diet that is high in fat and sugar, your stomach bacteria will be fundamentally different than someone who is on a vegan diet. If you were to take two identical twins from the same starting age and feed one a high sugar/carb diet with little fiber and the other a perfect Paleo/Mediterranean diet high in fiber and good fats, they would turn out to be two fundamentally different people cognitively and behaviorally. I could almost guarantee that the kid with the high carb processed diet would turn out with less mental acuity, emotional intelligence, and overall health. He’d probably get an ADHD diagnosis early, and may even exhibit symptoms on the autistic spectrum before he hits puberty. What if this is entirely implicated by your gut bacteria and diet? What if the antibiotics that he took when he was 10 permanently destroyed a strain of bacteria in his gut that was benefiting him cognitively, and he was never the same after? I dunno about some of you, but I fell into a deep depression coincidentally after I had done a couple years of antibiotics and I’m still slowly getting my shit together. If gut bacteria and intestinal health are important enough to effect neurotransmitter levels, BDNF production, neurogenesis, and other beneficial cognitive functions, then shouldn’t our goal be to have a healthy flora above all else?

The more I read about this, the more I feel like we have been misled and unjustly coerced into an unhappy life through the diets forced on us via advertising and grocery store isles. If you look at how food affects you neurologically, then it’s safe to say that the typical American diet is probably one of the “most addicting”. Sugar is addicting, period. It light’s your brain up the exact same way that cocaine does and while it doesn’t have the same systemic addictive effects, you certainly have withdrawals if you cut a 500g a day sugar habit to 0. Same goes for fatty or unhealthy processed food. The goal of any bacteria is to grow and populate. It’s in the gut bacteria’s evolutionary best interest to continue pumping out feel good neurotransmitters that your brain likes, so your brain will associate that food with positive emotions and try to maintain the cycle. Does it suffice to say that your second brain might have some control over you?  





**Dietary Suggestions and Supplemental Alternatives**

Everyone should already be taking magnesium, vitamin D, and digestive enzymes. You can’t get NAG from diet, so this is only thing I'd recommend supplementing. If you want the maximum benefits, then please eat right while introducing these strains of bacteria into your gut. Taking probiotics with a bad diet isn’t a good idea in my opinion. You risk the chance of developing worse problems if one of the “good strains” gets out of whack too and wreaks havoc on your immune system or inflammatory process. Paleo/Mediterranean diet is what I’d recommend following being that keto can be a tad low on fiber. You want lots of diverse plant fibers from fruit, vegetables, and nuts - as well as the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects produced with green leafy vegetables.

**Final Notes**

I know this seems like a lot of work, and for those of you who have severe anxiety or depression, I understand wholeheartedly how hard keeping up with this shit is. I’ve been through several cycles of diets, nootropics, addictions, and exercise phases, and I was never able to maintain it. I would always relapse to bad habits out of need for immediate comfort. That’s the bitch about depression and anxiety. You know what you need to do and you know what steps are required to make your life better, but you just can’t find the mental motivation to do it. I believe discipline is a muscle of consciousness and if you don’t exercise daily, it atrophies. If there is one nootropic that helps exercise this discipline muscle and maintain good habits, it’d be P21(with meditation). I’ve taken it on/off for just over a month now, and its effects on my mental willpower have been completely unmatched. I no longer sit and ruminate with procrastinating anxiety about all the shit I needed to do, I just fucking do it now because I know I’m investing in my future happiness and it'll be worth it long term(as cheesy as that sounds). Being content used to be my only goal in life, and now I realize how pointless that is. You need goals and struggle to reach those truly rewarding happy moments, everything can't be great all the time. So take 2 weeks and plan out every meal, supplement, meditation session, and exercise routine and follow it precisely. Just know that while you feel shitty and anxiety ridden right now, I can almost guarantee at the end of the 2 week mark you’ll feel better than you ever have and you'll want to continue some of the habits you've learned. If you fall back into depression, so be it, just learn something while you try to claw your way back out again. Eventually it'll come together. :)

/u/Guacamolium,311,2lb1dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2lb1dp/uguacamolium/,139,1415168953.0,"Unfortunately, I have some bad news. Jason (/u/Guacamolium), my business partner and co-founder of Ceretropic has died. He was found dead in his apartment on Friday afternoon. He had not come in for a few days, and was not answering his phone. I got a little worried, so /u/Synzael and I decided to go check on him. After he did not answer, we decided to get the police to come down. When they entered his apartment, they found him dead inside.

The toxicology screen will not be back for a few weeks. However, Jason had been having a few problems with Xanax and drinking. He was never one to be careful with his own safety, and would often have horrible insomnia. This led to him turning to Xanax and alcohol to try and get a little bit of sleep some nights. I let him know how irresponsible that was, but he never really got the message. There were a few occasions that I found him passed out after taking too much. I made him get into a substance abuse program, which he had been going to regularly. However, I never felt he was taking it seriously enough. I had hoped that he had things under control, but always feared that something would happen. I just figured it would be him getting in trouble, or driving on it and getting in an accident. I never expected the worst.

I know a lot of you spoke to Jason often about all manner of things. He was a very intelligent person, with a lot of great ideas. This is a big loss for Ceretropic, and the community as a whole. We would always have long sessions, where we would bounce new ideas off each other. Our personalities worked very well together for coming up with new compounds. He would always be sort of out there with optimism, and I would bring a healthy level of pragmatism to the equation; which led to a good creative environment. It's going to be very different without him around.

Anyone out there that has someone they know that is going through a tough time, please take the time to try and help them. **People in general, but especially us in the nootropic community, like to see ourselves as invincible. We never consider the possibility that one wrong measurement could be the end of us. I think this should be a wake up call for many of us out there being a little too cavalier with our safety. You never know what moment could be your last.** I wish I could have been a better friend to Jason, and possibly helped prevent this from happening. However, I know that hindsight is always 20/20. I hope that this incident can help us all to strive to be more careful with our safety, and reach out to those that we know need a little help. Jason was a very good guy, and he will be missed.

Ceretropic will continue to operate as normally as we can. Please bear with us for any delays in the coming weeks. ",2014-11-05 01:29:13
Theacrine - Not a mere Caffeine substitute,313,bdnsro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bdnsro/theacrine_not_a_mere_caffeine_substitute/,50,1555405341.0,"Theacrine, also known as 1,3,7,9-Methyluric Acid is a real buzz compound on r/nootropics. However, very little is yet known about Theacrine and few studies have been made. Many claims are made with few sources - in this post I will summarize studies on Theacrine to possibly elucidate some of its properties.

When searched for on Pubmed, Theacrine returns 25 results. A significant amount of these are regarding chemical reactions or plant synthesis routes. These will be ignored, as they are irrelevant.

Theacrine has locomotor-activating effects in rodent models, primarily through binding to Adenosine receptors. The study does however suggest that Theacrine might be directly acting through Dopamine receptors, as D1 and D2 antagonists block the increase in locomotion.^[1]

This is however misleading as not only do D1 and D2 antagonists decrease locomotion all on their own, blocking these receptors has also been shown to prevent locomotor activation in Caffeine-treated rats.^[2]

Indeed, Caffeine and other A1 antagonists have been shown to induce Dopamine release in the Nucleus Accumbens.^[3]

Thus while it cannot be completely ruled out that Theacrine binds to Dopamine receptors directly, it is exceedingly unlikely. The study, in proper context, suggests that Theacrine is solely an Adenosine receptor antagonist. This also seems to be the most logical conclusion to draw as of now.

Theacrine also exerts antagonistic effects in combination with Caffeine, several studies confirm that Theacrine potentiates Pentobarbital-induced sleep, as opposed to Caffeine which attenuates it.^[4][5]

In fact, Theacrine alone attenuates Caffeine-induced insomnia in rats and increases Adenosine content in the hippocampus of rats. Even further, Theacrine significantly reverses the decrease in Pentobarbital-induced sleeping time induced by selective A1 antagonist DPCPX and selective A2A antagonist SCH58261.^[5]

Thus Theacrine can not possibly have the same activity at Adenosine receptors as Caffeine, since they exert antagonistic effects in rats. I should also add here that Caffeine is most likely an inverse agonist at the A2aR.^[6]

Although we don't have conclusive evidence of this, I'd like to suggest that Theacrine is a partial agonist at Adenosine receptor sites. Additionally, the most exhaustive article on Theacrine available also suggests this possibility.^[7]

Additionally, unlike Caffeine, Theacrine exerts no effects on blood pressure or heartrate.^[8]

It can thus be deemed unlikely that Theacrine like Caffeine causes release of ACTH, Cortisol and Epinephrine, although no conclusive evidence exists as of yet.^[9] However it has been noted that Theacrine does not exert traditional thermogenic effects like Caffeine and Citrus Aurantium does.^[7]

Furthermore, Theacrine has demonstrated analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in rat models.^[10]

This effect is not shared by Caffeine. As a layman I will suggest that Theacrine might have activity at the A3R, since it mediates widespread and significant inflammatory responses. However, there is no evidence of this perspective.^[11]

Theacrine also lowers serum cholesterol in human trials.^[12] Caffeine seems to exert a weak opposite effect, Coffee having been noted to increase serum LDL-Cholesterol.^[13]

Finally, Theacrine has no hazardous interactions with Caffeine in adult humans.^[14]

***TL;DR***

Theacrine is not an agonist of, nor does it bind to, any of the Dopamine receptors. It is most likely a partial agonist at Adenosine receptors or induces Adenosine release by other mechanisms, since it has opposite effects to Caffeine and Theobromine in rat studies utilizing Pentobarbital.

Theacrine is not thermogenic, it has positive effects on motivation and pain but will not burn fat any faster than placebo. It has strong antiinflammatory effects, however the significance of this is not yet known. It lowers total serum cholesterol levels.

I believe an important amount of posters in this subreddit GREATLY underestimate the placebo effect,305,44ncd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/44ncd7/i_believe_an_important_amount_of_posters_in_this/,163,1454904989.0,"I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for saying this, but fuck it. It's my opinion and I need to express it:

I really think that a lot of people here underestimate the potency of the placebo effect. I see these threads about how l-theanine ""cured"" somebody's crippling anxiety, or how they used to be a loser but since taking piracetam all the sudden they are super smart and shit, and I cannot help but feel very skeptical towards such claims.

I know very well that a specific substance can work even if you don't ""feel"" anything. I also know that people have different brain chemistry, etc. 
But consider this:

People tend to think that they are immune to placebo, but that's simply not the case. Nobody is. Even the smartest person in the world can get fed an illusion. The placebo effect is very, **VERY** powerful and should definitely not be underestimated.

We would definitely benefit from more double-blind self-tests à la Gwern.


Therefore, unless you do rigorous double-blinded self-experiments to eliminate, or at the very least -limit- the possibility of placebo effect, please don't tell people how ""l-theanine **definitely** cured my anxiety !!!!1!!1"" and use words such as ""seems to"" and ""may have"" more often.",2016-02-07 23:16:29

Yet many of the reports are in conflict, and there is no consensus on the general efficacy of almost anything - this is because the missing half of the equation is you.


The medical field also suffers from this: its tools are blunt sledgehammers like benzos, tricyclics and SNRI/NDRIs that may fix 2-3 things while breaking two (often more) previously balanced systems. Even things as ubiquitous seeming as ADD, ADHD and Anxiety are being recognized as having many possible causes (and consequently, sub-types). 


There is little mystery as to how things like 5-HTP, Picamilon or Choline will impact ""the brain"". What's missing is the guide which will let people find out how they will impact THEIR brain. To solve this, we need to shift from substance-centric to neurochemistry-centric discussion. For now, I'm simply encouraging every user to do their own research.

Background story: Ever since hitting puberty, I've experienced a great deal of anxiety, both generalized and social. I always knew something was just not right with me, only later to find out I have Asperger's. People with this condition tend to have some special interests they obsess over, and something I love researching/experimenting with is nootropics. My main goal was getting my anxiety and moods under control, and I've tried dozens and dozens of nootropics/vitamins/supplements for this reason. I've experimented with many other nootropics for memory/cognitive-enhancement/mental-sharpness, but for the sake of this post, I will talk about ones that have helped me with anxiety. I've noticed many subscribers of this subreddit also suffer from anxiety, and a calm mind is one of the best nootropics there is IMO. This community is awesome and has helped me a lot, so hopefully this post will help someone else! I rated each of them in terms of personal anxiety relief. Remember, what didn't work for me might work for you, and vice versa. I just realized halfway through writing this that its a really long post, so I'll break it up into a few parts instead for time purposes.

-Bacopa (7/10): My first nootropic experience, and it was a good one. I noticed acute effects of lowered anxiety, and over the course of a few months noticed increased memory. This amazing herb is subltle enough that I feel normal, but noticable enough that I felt less stress and anxiety. I didn't even realize how great it was until I got off of it, and started experienceing my usual increased anxiety. It wasnt like an acute ""Wow, I feel so calm"" feeling, more like a background calm. Like turning down the volume of anxiety a couple of notches. Looking back at it, the 6-7 months I used it I was in a much better place mentally.

-Theanine (2/10): I know this is very popular in this subreddit, but personally I felt no noticable effects from it. I've tried suntheanine, and a few other brands since it is pretty hyped on here and similar forums, but unfortunately I'm just personally a non-responder. I would recommend trying this if you suffer from anxiety, since many people find it helps them. 

-Phenibut(10/10): My holy grail of social anxiety relief. The first time I took it was absolutely mind blowing. I was about 17 working at a supermarket bagging groceries (LOL) and dealing with terrible anxiety, especially social anxiety; talking to customers all day made me very on edge all day and mentally drained at the end of the day. I tried a 1 gram dose of phenibut, and 4 hours later, I felt the best I have ever felt in my life. ""The world was my playground"" is quote from a fellow redditor that perfectly describes my experience with this substance. I was flirting with girls, hi-fiving everybody, and just felt fucking awesome. Like I just felt great to be alive, everyone felt like a good friend, and I was so charming/whitty/outgoing. Unfortunately as many of you already know, these effects are not sustainable with regular use and rebound anxiety is a bitch. Fortunately, this led me to research the mechanisms of action of phenibut and Gaba-B, which led to my discovery of the following substance.

-Baclofen(10/10): Not really a nootropic, but it felt identical to phenibut. Whats even better, I was able to take it regularly and keep the anxiety-reducing benefits of phenibut without the extreme tolerance and other side effects. I'm convinced I have some kind of gaba-B dysfuntion, because baclofen causes me to feel normal. I'm more comfortable in social situations, and its effects on empathy and mood have made this an absolute staple for me.

-Kava-Kava (6/10): First I tried cheap Kava, then was told I have to make my own kava from a good powder. My experiences were not that great: terrible taste, headaches, and groggyness were the main effects I got from this. Oh, and a slight anxiety reduction. I have read that kava has a reverse tolerance(meaning the longer you take it, the stronger the effects are). I want to continue experimenting with this though, because I dont believe I've taken it for long enough periods and maybe my quality of root was not that great.

-Picamilon(4/10): Another popular anxiety nootropic, unfortunately it didnt do much for me. I've read many people are not very impressed with it either, howevery YMMV.

-N-acetyl-cystine(9/10): This stuff is awesome, and is another staple for me. My experience with NAC is less intrusive thoughts, decrease in impulsiveness, and it literally CURED my trichtillomania. It also prevents hangovers for me when taken a couple of hours before a night out drinking with friends.

-Memantine (7/10): For the first few days, I felt amazing on it. I definitely felt an increased mood and decreased anxiety. Those effects subdued, and I was left with some mood stabilization and tolerance reduction to stimulants.

-Colouracetam(7/10): This is my favorite racetam. I feel an increase in mood and a nice, clear, calm mind. For some reason, Ceretropic's sublingual version is the only one that I feel noticable effects from. I will probably end up buying some bulk powder from them, because I'm thinking maybe I just got some bunk powder from the other vendor I tried.

-Noopept(6/10): This stuff has such a psychedelic vibe for me. An increase in colors and an appreciation for scenery (LOL) are the main effects I felt from it. It didnt do too much for my anxiety, but I did find taking it sublingually helped my verbal fluidity in social situations, so that definetly a plus.

-Aniracetam (6/10): This is a popular racetam that many users descibe as being anxiolytic. Besides the first few doses, it did not do too much for my anxiety personally. I even tried taking it with Omega-3 as someone suggested to me, and still nothing too noticeable. I may try this one again, maybe this time with a regular 3x daily dosage. The only effect that I really enjoyed was making music sound better, and that also faded after the first few doses.

-Phosphatidylserine (8/10): I know that the bovine sources are not used anymore for this supplement and other sources of it do not have very good research, but it made a pretty big impact as far as stress reduction for me. I felt less physical anxiety in social situations, and did not get as hot as I would during social interaction. Normally I would start sweating bullets, my voice would crack, and people who shook my hand would ask me why my palms were so sweaty. lol

I was initially going to write all my experiences but didnt realize how long this post became. This is only a fraction of my experiences, and I will write up the rest if anyone is interested. Off the top of my head, I have also tried bromantane, ashwaghanda, emoxypine, etifoxine, holy basil, low dose naltrexone, tianeptine, klonopin, semax, inositol, DMAE, galantamine, PEA, 5-HTP, gabapentin, rhodiola, kratom, L-tryptophan/tyrosine, and some others as well. Let me know if there are any of those you would like for me to write a review on.",2015-04-27 05:44:49

Recently there was a post about the relation between gut health and mental health, and it piqued my interest in creating a stack to help facilitate healing and microbriome regrowth. After diving into google scholar articles and acknowledging the relation between gut health and mental acuity, I'm convinced this is the best stack to assist with repairing your microbiome and gut health. I started a variation of this stack a couple months ago in addition to some other noots/peptides, and it's made some subtle but perceptible improvements in my life already. Hopefully it helps ya'll too. 


**Studies**

* [Stress & the gut-brain axis: Regulation by the microbiome](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289516300509)
 * The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stress-related conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations.
 * Several lines of evidence support the suggestion that gut microbiota influence stress-related behaviours, including those relevant to anxiety and depression. Work using germ-free (GF) mice (i.e., delivered surgically and raised in sterile isolators with no microbial exposure) demonstrates a link between microbiota and anxiety-like behaviour (Neufeld et al., 2011; Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011 ;  Clarke et al., 2013). In particular, reduced anxiety-like behaviour in GF mice was shown in the light-dark box test and in the elevated plus maze (see (Luczynski et al., 2016a) for review). On the other hand, GF rats display the opposite phenotype, and are characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviour (Crumeyrolle-Arias et al., 2014). Interestingly, the transfer of stress-prone Balb/C microbiota to GF Swiss Webster (SW) mice has been shown to increase anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal SW mice, while transfer of SW microbiota to GF Balb/C mice reduced anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal Balb/C mice suggesting a direct role for microbiota composition in behaviour (Bercik et al., 201
 * Gene expression within the hippocampus also is markedly different in GF mice compared to normal controls. The hippocampus exerts strong control over the HPA stress axis, and GF mice are characterized by markedly increased hippocampal 5-HT concentrations (Clarke et al., 2013), accompanied by decreased 5-HT1A receptor gene expression in the dentate gyrus in female (but not male) GF mice (Neufeld et al., 2011). Intriguingly, other CNS alterations in GF mice also are sex-dependent; e.g., altered expression of BDNF has been documented only in male GF mice (Clarke et al., 2013). BDNF is an important plasticity-related protein that promotes neuronal growth, development and survival, with key roles in learning, memory and mood regulation. BDNF gene expression is lower in the cortex and amygdala in male GF mice compared with controls (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011), whereas hippocampal BDNF levels in GF mice have been reported to either increase (Neufeld et al., 2011) or decrease (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2013 ;  Sudo et al., 2004).
 * Therefore, gut microbiota may play a crucial role in tryptophan availability and metabolism to consequently impact central 5-HT concentrations. Although the specific mechanisms underlying this putative modulatory interaction are unknown, they are potentially mediated indirectly through an immune-related mechanism linked to microbial colonization 
 * **Animal studies have led the way in showing that specific strains of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus or Bacteroides can have positive effects on brain and behaviour ( Hsiao et al., 2013; Bravo et al., 2011; Bercik et al., 2011b; Savignac et al., 2014 ;  Savignac et al., 2015), including evidence that certain bacteria can enhance cognitive processes and affect emotional learning**


* [Gut–brain axis: how the microbiome influences anxiety and depression](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/60c0/58682d907fe80befc23e58f279d34ade23f1.pdf)
 * Significant progress has been made over the past decade in
recognizing the importance of gut microbiota to brain
function. Key findings show that stress influences the
composition of the gut microbiota and that bidirectional
communication between microbiota and the CNS influences
stress reactivity. Several studies have shown that
microbiota influence behavior and that immune challenges
that influence anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors are
associated with alterations in microbiota. Emerging work
notes that alterations in microbiota modulate plasticityrelated,
serotonergic, and GABAergic signaling systems in
the CNS. Going forward, there is a significant opportunity
to consider how the gut–brain axis and, in particular, new
tools will allow researchers to understand how dysbiosis of
the microbiome influences mental illness.


* [A randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159115000884)
 *  We found that a 4-week multispecies probiotic intervention reduced self-reported cognitive reactivity to sad mood, as indexed by the LEIDS-r (van der Does and Williams, 2003; van der Does, 2005 ;  Kruijt et al., 2013). Further analyses showed that the strongest beneficial effects were observed for the aggression and rumination subscales, indicating that in the probiotics supplementation condition participants perceived themselves to be less distracted by aggressive and ruminative thoughts when in a sad mood.

**Forgot to mention EDIT:** For those of you who eat a lot of bad food, be aware of a possible Herxheimer reaction if cutting a lot of sugar/carbs in conjunction with this stack. A year ago, I went hard into keto after being on a very high sugar/high carb diet, and I had what is typically called ""the keto flu"", but I believe this effect is more due to the massive die off of bacteria in your gut that feeds on sugars and carbs. I've had a few friends try this similar stack(high sugar diets), and have a ""sick"" couple of days in the beginning even though they only cut back on some sugary stuff. Light migraine, sore throat/tonsils, and general fatigue. Feels like a 100% manageable flu, but it's still unpleasant. Anti-inflammatory supplements help with this but only so much. This typically lasts a day or two. 


**FINAL EDIT Summary:** 

I think this stack covers a large majority of the bases required to propagate gut flora and increase general intestinal health, while providing nootropic benefits in relation to social fluidity, mood, mental energy, and emotional health. Starting with the probiotic, I chose Garden of Life(100 Billion CFU) for a variety of reasons. First it has all the popular beneficial strains, in addition to a diverse amount of subtly mood boosting strains. After doing some googling, it looks like there is a decent balance between the histamine increasing/reducing, the immuno-modulator, nutrient absorption promoting, mood boosting, anti inflammatory, and  stool improving strains. Taking GOL in addition to the prebiotic strain from Vitamin Shoppe provides all the prebiotic goodness to help facilitate the beneficial flora to grow and actually populate the gut long term. 


Glutamine, NAG, Quercetin, Collagen, and Aloe Vera juice all help grow the intestinal mucosa back to its normal state, and regrow the Microvillus that gets damaged with chronic bowel disease. For the good bacteria to stick around long term, it needs that mucous layer for protection. Another important factor that most people overlook in gut health is digestive enzymes. Certain strains of bacteria can change the acidity of your stomach and intestines, which can cause all sorts of problems with digestive effectiveness and as a result, your nutrient absorption. Super enzymes are a staple in any one of my stacks, simply because you can never digest food too well, right? The last 3 supplements are Caprylic Acid/Coconut Oil, Omega 3s, and Vitamin D. Omega 3s and Coconut oil both assist with Butyrate production, which provides tremendous benefits with ""how you feel"" via its anti-inflammatory action. It also helps with weight loss and insulin sensitivity. Vitamin D is also a general fix all and something everyone should be taking. Unless you work outside for a large majority of your day, you're probably not getting enough vitamin D. 4000IU is the recommended daily allowance, so 5000IU should be fine for everyone. Vitamin D is also essential for gene functions that pertain gut flora, as well as anti-inflammatory pathways regulated via the VDR receptors. Hopefully this helps you folks with gut problems get back to guaranteed regularity, it's certainly helped me.

I’ve listed below my experience.

**Product**: Organic 8:1 Dual-Extract, Fruiting Bodies (Nammex) capsules

**Vendor**: Mindnutrition 

**Dose**: 1000mg daily on an empty stomach

**Advantages:**

* I felt more motivated than usual, a subtle urge to be productive every day. I started taking Lion’s Mane right after finishing my exams and usually, after a long time of studying, I would waste my vacation playing video games and doing other time-wasting activities. This time, I decided to pick up a book that I was intending to read for a very long time, started watching many documentaries mainly for educational purposes and I’ve also spent many hours a day working on a website that I created a while ago. It was a subtle change at first but I really appreciated the effects after I stopped taking it a few days ago as I ran out of mushrooms.
* Better recall and more organized thoughts; I noticed that my thoughts became more organized which was reflected in my articulation as I noticed that words were flowing seamlessly and were easily recalled. Not a huge difference that people can see but I could definitely notice myself.
* Dreams were more vivid and structured; it resembled real places and people which was really weird. At times, I could easily remember the dream after waking up; this encouraged me to start a dream journal for the first time. I must say that experiencing vivid dreams is not usually a good trip. Vivid dreams mean vivid nightmares which can get scary and intense. I remember waking up one morning feeling my head pounding after exchanging fire with a group of vigilantes from the roof of my house. Good stuff.

**Disadvantages**:

* At the start of taking Lion’s Mane, I experienced a headache during the first week or so. I kept on taking the same dose and eventually headache was gone.
* Thoughts could sometimes be overwhelming monkeying around and intersecting with each other. Socializing and conversing help to get all of these thoughts out.
* Vivid nightmares. I have to say that dreams are very much related to your mood in general so Lion’s Maine doesn’t cause nightmares instead, it makes it more vivid.

**TLDR**; Lion’s Mane mushrooms helped me to be more motivated and productive. I noticed that my thoughts became more organized and easily recalled. I also experienced vivid dreams which could be intense at times.",2020-05-15 00:47:39

I ended up coming first in my class with the highest grades by far, something I’d attribute to the supplement. 

At some point early last year I stopped taking it because I didn’t feel like I needed it anymore for anxiety and I could deal with stress a lot better. Afterwards I genuinely think it had a huge positive impact on my anxiety long term. Things that previously used to cause me stress just didn’t any more. 

Anyway, let’s fast forward to now. I recently started a new job that requires 2 solid months of classroom based training and there’s lots of information to take in that we’re tested on. I find it extremely hard to take in and stay focused over long periods of time, despite consuming coffee throughout the day. 

On the Friday of the second week we took a group test and I ended up scoring literally bottom of the group. Disappointing. 

The following Monday I had fairly bad non-work related anxiety, so I took some L-theanine and caffeine and continued to do so throughout the week and onto the following week also. By the end of the fourth week we had another test which I didn’t have a clue was coming which was supposed to be a lot more intense than the first. 

Long story short, I scored highest in the group, by a really significant margin, from being literally lowest.

You could put it down to being conscious of my performance and focusing more based on that, but I know myself I didn’t. Literally nothing changed apart from taking that supplement.",2020-01-10 20:21:21
"Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamin B6, Iron and Vitamin C may play a prominent role in ADHD.",295,ae8m21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ae8m21/zinc_magnesium_vitamin_b6_iron_and_vitamin_c_may/,94,1547081004.0,"[Micronutrient Deficiencies in ADHD: A Global Research Consensus](https://isom.ca/article/micronutrient-deficiencies-adhd-global-research-consensus/)

&#x200B;

Summary:  Mineral deficiencies may play a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, and Vitamin B6 appear to have substantial effects on ADHD symptoms. 

&#x200B;

**Zinc** 

Zinc deficiency represents one of the most-recognized micronutrient deficiencies linked to ADHD symptoms. With key roles in enzyme activation and neurotransmitter synthesis, zinc is critical for regulation of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). 

**Vitamin B6**

In addition to supporting magnesium metabolism, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), as pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), has independently essential roles in the nervous system, energy production, neurotransmitter synthesis, heme production, and is critical for strong immune function and the inflammatory response (Ho et al., 2016; Rucklidge et al., 2017; Ueland et al., 2017).

**Iron**

At appropriate concentrations, iron is another essential cofactor in the enzymatic production of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (Rucklidge et al., 2017). Most reliably assessed by serum ferritin, low iron status is a significant but heterogeneous risk factor for ADHD.

**Magnesium**

Possibly the most crucial micronutrient for optimal brain performance, magnesium participates in virtually all enzyme reactions, nerve signal conduction, and in the function of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Magnesium also plays a key role in the excitation status of nerves through inhibition of excitatory glutamate receptors and promotion of GABA reception (Greenblatt, 2017). Deficiency of magnesium is identified in almost all cases of ADHD, and is widespread even in healthy populations (Moshfegh, A. et al., 2009).

**Vitamin C**

Vitamin C is a critical component of the antioxidant system. Heightened oxidative stress caused by chronic inflammation, heavy metal or other environmental exposures, and hyperexcited neurons place heavy demands on the brain’s antioxidant system. ",2019-01-09 19:43:24

If you have ever **hated having to pay for journal articles** then read on.

Many of these articles can be found for free.

[1] **Google Scholar** - https://scholar.google.com/

   The ""advance search"" option (drop-down on the right side) helps find articles by title, author, publications and by publication date.

[2] Free JSTOR account - http://www.jstor.org/

   This gives you 3 articles a month for free.  I list this below google scholar because there are no questions about copyright and legality.  I PERSONALLY NEVER USE THIS as Canada has better copyright laws than most so it is not worth the trouble.

[3] Reddit Scholar - https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/

   This is a great place to ask someone else to do the work for you.  Again, I find it easier to get the stuff myself.  Mostly I learned how through /r/scholar

[4] Libgen - http://libgen.io/scimag/

  **This is magic** Go to Libgen.  Search for a subject.  Download free PDF.  You don’e even have to know the author or proper title. For example, a search on “caffeine” gives me the first 100 results (telling me I should be more specific to get exactly what I want).  A search for [lions mane](http://libgen.io/scimag/?s=lion%27s+mane&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1) gives me 21 results including a review by the title [Chemistry, Nutrition, and Health-Promoting Properties of Hericium erinaceus {Lion’s Mane} Mushroom Fruiting Bodies and Mycelia and Their Bioactive Compounds](http://cyber.sci-hub.bz/MTAuMTAyMS9hY3MuamFmYy41YjAyOTE0/10.1021%40acs.jafc.5b02914.pdf).

 **Note that many Libgen articles are downloaded from Sch-Hub**.  If the libgen servers are busy, you often get redirected to Sci-Hub for your search.

[5] Sci-Hub - http://sci-hub.io/

   The [wiki on Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) says

>Sci-Hub is a website with over 62 million academic papers and articles available for direct download. **It bypasses publisher paywalls by allowing access through educational institution proxies.** Sci-Hub stores papers in its own repository, and additionally the papers downloaded by Sci-Hub are also stored in Library Genesis (LibGen).


Sometimes when searching on Sci-Hub you get this message

>search temporarily unavailable, please use DOI or direct links

>If you're using Google chrome, you can install Sci-Hub extension to use search.
To do this: . . . 

They give a download link for a google chrome extension - click, unzip and install.

Sci-Hub does not work every time as publishers are always working against them, but it has every paper you want.

EDIT:

/u/jminuse gives a good caution to **look for review articles** when you are new to a subject.  Also, if there are multiple reviews don't forget to read the most recent one.

ALSO - **Never draw conclusions from one study.**

For example a google scholar search of [bacopa review](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bacopa+review) is a much better starting place than just random searching. (still over 7600 found)

Searching the [same with LibGen](http://libgen.io/scimag/?s=bacopa+review&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1) gives 5 results that are exactly what I was looking for.

Thoughts from Three Years in the Game,285,3h8px4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3h8px4/thoughts_from_three_years_in_the_game/,73,1439789976.0,"**edit:** Thanks for the Gold!

In the summer of 2012, I was returning to school, eager to get ahead, and came across [this post](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/36691-ten-months-of-research-condensed-a-total-newbies-guide-to-nootropics/) after doing a cursory search for 'smart drugs.' With that, my journey into the world of nootropics began.


I don't necessarily want to do a review of every substance I've tried so much as offer some insights over what I've observed, both within myself and the community these past few years.

1) **Like any community, the nootropics scene periodically undergoes trends, fads and changing consensuses.** When I first began frequenting Longecity and /r/nootropics, the general consensus was the -racetams (so long as you were a responder) represented the best risk/reward available, modafinil was the closest thing to a real world 'Limitless' drug, and a handful of other substances (e.g., pyritinol, bacopa, ALCAR, etc.) were of varying benefit. Fast forward a year or so and hype around CILTEP reached fever pitch, only to be thoroughly debunked by a popular post here. At some point in between, phenylpiracetam became more widespread at economical prices (for awhile, its high cost was a barrier), tianeptine rose from an obscure antidepressant to one of the more well-known nootropics, and uridine+DHA+choline was regarded by some as one of the best longer-term stacks. Later still, Semax, Selank et al. became household names, risk tolerances transitioned markedly from demanding a near absence of side effects to an overarching willingness to experiment with research chemicals holding little-to-no human safety evidence, and the downsides of phenibut became thoroughly entrenched in popular opinion. 3 years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if the popular discourse had changed further still.

**2) Anecdotally, I've found the best nootropics tend to be Russian.** I'm not sure whether it's arisen from a need for solutions to the resulting bran damage that high incidences of alcoholism inflicts, a scientific community more willing to pursue treatments intended to improve rather than simply treat, or something else endogenous to the culture, but invariably, my best experiences have come from Russian nootropics - e.g., phenylpiracetam, Semax, bromantane and to a lesser extent, Noopept.

**3) My responses to various substances have evolved over time.** When I first took piracetam, I felt a sense of immense clear-headedness. Now I'm lucky if I even remember taking it halfway through the day, and question whether it grants anything beyond placebo. (Evidence of benefit among healthy samples essentially boils down to a single study from the 70's; see [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00426834).) Likewise, various adaptogens were godsends for my focus, energy and alertness; now, I hardly feel much of anything from the likes of ginkgo, ginseng, rhodiola, etc. Targeting micronutrient deficiencies might be at play here; unbeknownst to me at the time, I was fairly deficient in both vitamin D and B12 during my introduction to nootropics. Later lab tests uncovered both, and subsequent supplementation fixed a good deal of issues I had in terms of energy and sleep, yet coincided with a change in response to components of my stack.

**4) The often-discussed U-shaped response curve applies to nearly everything.** I recently read a post of someone complaining that this forum is excessively indulgent in prescribing exercise as the cure-all for everything, and that he had been doing so regularly and strenuously for the past few years with little in the way of benefits. Likely true. What else is true, though, especially across the current literature, is there is such a thing as both too little and too much exercise  (see [1](http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleID=2108914)). Similarly, while the health food world is awash in kale-love, overconsumption might end up exposing oneself to high levels of thallium (see [2](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2015/07/kale-silent-killer)). The same can be said for excessive reliance on stimulants, high levels of supplemental antioxidants, etc. On the other hand, the benefits of quality aerobic, strength and HIIT-based workouts is insane when dosed appropriately, and has led to more personal benefits than anything else outside the concurrent use of a few select stimulants, Russian compounds, meditation and diet. In earlier times, I was on the extreme end of the spectrum when I reached a semi-elite amateur level in competitive endurance sports - and had little to show in terms of cognitive fluidity.

**5) Simple stacks are often best; distilling a stack down to its most effective components is underrated.** People (ideally) tend to transition across three stages in their nootropics journey: i) dipping one's feet in the water with a few 'starter' nootropics, e.g., caffeine + theaine, piracetam + ALCAR, etc.; ii) an aggressive experimentation phase where the aim is to figure out what works in a swift manner; and iii) a return to the basics once one determines what personally benefits them. Far too often, I read reports where someone has tried whatever the current research chemical du-jour is and writes a glowing report after < 1 week's usage, only to detail that they also take a plethora of other RC's, a few prescriptions and possibly occasional dips into pyschoactive, non-nootropic compounds. Such reports, IMO, are completely bogus with the amount of confounding factors present. The reality that doesn't get acknowledged often enough is we often have little-to-no data on long-term outcomes for even the classic nootropics, let alone combinations of such. The last place you want to be is taking 12 different things, have a debilitating side effect creep in and not have any idea where it's arising from.

**6) At some point, you have to really ask yourself about personal risk tolerances.** I think a general consensus around here is the willingness to trade long-term uncertainty for short-to-mid-term benefits. The question is, at what point does the trade-off begin to lose value? For example, could you tolerate persistent paresthesia, tinnitus, etc., if it meant improving cognition, improving anxiety, removing depression, etc.? How about a trade-off in working memory if it meant being able to memorize things photographically, perhaps to the point where you forgot what your manager just said seconds after walking away? Oftentimes, free lunches are tough to find in the world of homeostasis.

**7) Figure out your lowest-hanging fruit and target that first.** For me, figuring out a deficiency in B12 and D were godsends. Later, figuring out that I had polymorphisms at the SNP level signaling a lifelong greater need for said vitamins was enlightening as to why I became deficient in the first place despite abundant sunlight and animal product consumption. Likewise, going from a few weeks of near-complete sedentary work to 3-4 days of cardio and strength training has swift, dramatic effects on my rapidity of thought, ability to internalize technical subjects, and general mood/outlook.

**8) Know thyself - otherwise, it's easy to get caught up on others' glowing reports.** A perfect example would be tianeptine - invariably, a handful of people with debilitating depression have found immense benefits and few downsides given appropriate dosages. Said people have gone on to write glowing reports when the subject comes up. Myself, being the curious mind that I am, read such reports and decide I might like to experience said benefits myself - while momentarily neglecting that I have neither clinical depression nor the same brain chemistry as those whose posts I'm reading. Conversely, I find that nootropics that are popular among the ADHD crowd tend to have disproportionately positive effects - e.g., uridine+DHA+choline, Semax, etc. Yet modafinil is occasionally touted for its concentration-enhancing effects, and I've personally found it to be almost anti-nootropic in that I have an abundance of wakefulness but lose out on creativity, problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

**9) Some of the best nootropics are often not things you can find in a pill.** For example, when I had regular access to a sauna, I found the combination of hot and cold exposure to be immensely beneficial both for focus and sleep. When I'm in areas where natural settings are readily accessible, a few hours spent hiking leaves me thoroughly able to write well after. When I take a weekend sabbatical from smart devices, laptops, etc., I find my ability to sit down and be productive on a single task, like reading a demanding book, skyrockets. 

**10) Take breaks from time to time.** Nootropics, when they work, are awesome. Knowing your baseline is equally awesome. Saving money, even more so. Even with everything I've experimented with, I've found one of the most effective things in terms of boosting mood, productivity, rapidity of thought, etc. is strong espresso (and when the jitters arrive, a dash of theanine) after taking 3-4 weeks completely off caffeine. My response under such a scenario is almost to the point where if I could gain said benefits without the tolerance that comes from consistent use, I'd need little else. Invariably, the benefits begin decreasing after a week or so of use, and by week 3 or 4 of daily caffeine intake, the need to up dosages simply for the wakefulness aspect becomes a near-necessity. Breaks and their resultant tolerance reduction are awesome, though often highly inconvenient given a demanding work/academic schedule. When you have the chance, though, don't discount the utility of time away from the pill cabinet.",2015-08-17 01:39:36

"Toxoplasma Gondii is a very common brain parasite that has been implicated in a range of mental disorders and lower intelligence. Has somebody tested positive, got cured and perceived a change?",286,a0l02e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a0l02e/toxoplasma_gondii_is_a_very_common_brain_parasite/,157,1543279655.0,"Toxoplasma Gondii is a brain parasite that can infects all warm blooded animals and reproduces through the digestive system of cats.

&#x200B;

Higher incidence of Toxoplasma Gondii has been found in [suicide completers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3128543/), [schizophrenic patients](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article-abstract/38/3/642/1867672) and [bipolar disorder sufferers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322312000108). Toxoplasma Gondii is typically said to be asymptomatic in immunocompetent infected hosts and remains latent for its lifetime.

&#x200B;

Since this ""asymptomatic"" infection has been shown to be linked to [neurotransmitters imbalances](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395614002866) that could impair one's thinking process, I was wondering if somebody got cured and noticed a difference. The treatment usually involves a several month long course of combined antibiotics.

&#x200B;

The infection is very common, as in half of French, German and Belgian people are infected. Incidence in the US is lower at around 15%.

EDIT: Many people have mentioned that there is no cure. There are actually a large number of publications where patients that test positive initially can test again negative after a long-term treatment. They are summarized [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138204#sec021) (full citation below).

"Alright I'm fully convinced, gut microbiome and inflammation is DIRECTLY linked to depression/dysthymia. I just had got over a horrible case of giardia and experienced 180 degree flips in mood, energy, motivation.",286,9ssjnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9ssjnr/alright_im_fully_convinced_gut_microbiome_and/,160,1540965560.0,"Picked up Giardia when I was on the CDT this year. Had just finished Colorado and was on the last 700ish miles to go. Was feeling great, energized, excited to finish another thru-hike, doing 30-35miles a day. Then bam giardia hit and I started shitting and vomiting everything I ate or drank. Went from 178lbs to 163lbs in a matter of two weeks. I wasn't even able to keep water down and became extremely dehydrated in the first 4 days.

&#x200B;

I've suspected that the gut microbiome has played a large part in my fatigue and depression but getting giardia has convinced me beyond any doubt. It apparently likes to feed on glucose so you're not supposed to eat sugar. I didn't realize this in the first few days and tried to drink gatorades and eat ice-cream to get any sort of calories in my body. I noticed that immediately after ingesting the sugar, one I would very often throw up, but also my joints would flare up with pain. After almost 1,900 miles hiked my body was holding up surprisingly well and were mostly pain free but immediately after eating sugars they would all flare up with pain, which was a signal of inflammation. So the inflammation in my gut was carrying over to inflammation in the rest of the body.

&#x200B;

Well it got so bad I got off trail and came home. On trail I was really looking forward to coming home so I could relax, watch movies, and play video games. But when I actually got home for the life of me I couldn't get into ANY games or movies. They all had zero fun. I didn't want to do anything. Nothing was interesting or fun. Classic depression. 

&#x200B;

I wrote it off to being sick but even after I started to recover and put some weight back on the dysthymia stayed. It was only in the last few days when I've made a concerted effort to eliminate all sugar and get in loads of fiber from lentils and other veggies and also megadosing a probiotic that's worked well for me in the past that I've felt better. And the change has been overnight. Two days ago I was still feeling depressed and had no interest in anything. Today I had so much energy and motivation I went to the gym and am really getting into Path of Exile. 

&#x200B;

Oh another weird and interesting side-effect. I have HORRIBLE seasonal allergies which have only gotten worse as I've gotten older. In the last 5 years I have to blow my nose for an hour after waking up even in the dead of winter. Oddly when I had giardia I had zero sinus issues and even now my sinuses have been much more clear then they used to be. So it appears that my allergies are linked to my gut microbiome and whatever was causing it has been flushed out of my system. 

&#x200B;

Just wanted to share. If you suffer from a general malaise, lack of energy, lack of motivation, lack of interest in things you used to find interesting you might want to take a look at your diet and try some probiotics. I always knew that when I ""ate better"" I felt better but generally linked that to having more nutrients and less carbs thus less insulin response. Now I wonder if the true mechanism is more to do with whether you're feeding the ""good"" bacteria in your gut and starving the ""bad"" when you ""eat better"" rather than how your body handles the macronutrient content. Probably a mixture of both but I think the effect of the microbiome needs a lot more attention then we give it. ",2018-10-31 01:59:20

I have  dealt with anhedonia for over 12 years, likely longer.  I can't even remember the last time I felt joy.  I never really thought I was depressed, because I'm still a high functioning very productive person.  I never went to the doctor for feelings of depression for multiple reasons.  I have a great life, great job, terrific family, and my wife is the love of my life . . . . . . . just absolutely no joy.  I couldn't anticipate it.  I have had a pituitary adenoma for over 25 years (prolactinoma).  Rather large one that has responded to dostinex, but my prolactin levels are still much too high for a typical male.  No other side affects of the condition other than occasional headaches that I can tell, but I'm sure it's possible even likely to have affected my hormonal balance.  Dostinex is a dopamine agonist so I'm sure that is also playing a factor in all of this.  I started taking Lion's Mane  (2 weeks ago) on a whim with niacin as a result of hearing Paul Stamets.  The first week I noticed that I could think clearer, and that I was able to cope a little better with life.  I've always been a very critical person when it comes to small irritants.  Things like little messes around the house or illogical actions.  It would take everything within me not to speak critically or chastise someone for something they did.  Now I was able to brush it off, and take care of the small irritant myself.  That's weird . . . . . . REALLY weird.  Now at the end of week 2, and I am overwhelmed.  I went for a walk with my wife today and proclaimed that I could actually feel the wind on my face.  No, you don't get it.  I can FEEL the wind on my face.  The sun was shining, a breeze was blowing, the birds were singing.  I can't even describe it.  I actually called my mom last night.  That doesn't happen!  I talked to her for 2 hours!  Do you know how hard it is to sleep when you're feeling joy for the first time in a decade?  2 decades????  I had to get out of bed because I kept crying in my sleep thinking about my kids.  I feel like being interviewed on Oprah.  This is unreal.

&#x200B;

Update 04/13/2019:

It's been another week, and though the exuberance has subsided I am still feeling the positive affects of the LM/Niacin.  I really notice it when I do something new or go somewhere I haven't been for a while.  I visited my folks yesterday and when i walked into their house which I have done many times, I absolutely noticed the difference.  Everything was sharper and the lighting, though dim, seemed to have more energy.  It's like going from life with a 3 color palette to a 12 color palette.  We had a very lengthy conversation and I shared much of what I have been dealing with for the last 12 years.  It was wonderful.  I hadn't had a long personal conversation with them since I don't know when.  All because of the peace and joy that I now have.  They definitely noticed the change.  Needless to say after many hours of talking into the night, we hugged and I broke down in tears because of how happy I was to finally connect with them again.  We've always had a good relationship, but due to the state that I have been in for so long, I have harbored resentment and frustration.  I just couldn't figure out why no one could understand me.  I now have so much peace.  I love talking about deep and difficult topics, but now I can do it with much more grace.  It's great to still be feeling better and even better when others see it in you.",2019-04-06 14:27:36

Our ""organization"" has acquired many analytical chemistry tools for testing nootropics.

**Our inventory right now is** :

FTIR, UV/Vis, Raman Spectrometer

Melting point apparatus

TLC Places

Plenty of solvents

Reagents for heavy metal testing methods..

&#x200B;

I would like to open this resource as a **non-profit** in hope of **increasing safety** and fact checking around these parts. In addition I would like to see some people step forward to help lead this effort as I want this not to be my own project but a **community effort**.

&#x200B;

Our current website is:

A Common Sense Guide to Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus),281,d5f9g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d5f9g0/a_common_sense_guide_to_lions_mane_hericium/,89,1568746446.0,"Lion's Mane (Yamabushitake, Hericium erinaceus) is a mushroom that's thought to have nootropic effects. Lion's Mane has been used for over one thousand years in Chinese medicine as a treatment for 'gastricism' (it was thought that many disorders were caused by digestion issues). In recent years Lion's Mane has been researched because of its possible pro-cognitive effects. The research can be confusing so I thought I would dig into it and try to demystify Lion's Mane for myself and others.

There are many varieties of compounds in Lion's Mane but to date most of the research has focused on four main categories:

###Hericenones

Hericenones are aromatic compounds isolated from the fruiting body (the visible growth of the mushroom, often called the actual mushroom or toadstool, the part that produces spores) of Lion's Mane.

Hericenones C, D and E exhibit NGF stimulating activity. Of the Hericenones, Hericenone D is the most potent, almost as potent as epinephrine, the reference compound for NGF stimulation.

3-Hydroxyhericenone F has shown protective activity against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent Neuro2a cell death

###Erinacines

Erinacines are cyathane-type diterpenoid compounds that are derived from Lion's mane. These compounds tend to have NGF stimulating activity, interestingly they're not unique to Lion's mane. Scabronines A, B, C, D, E and F and Cyrneines A and B are another set of similar compounds with NGF stimulating activity, which were isolated from the fruiting bodies of Sarcodon scabrosus and Sarcodon cyrneus, respectively. Similar compounds can be found across multiple species, including the mushroom cyathus africanus [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20472-4) and the fungus cyathus striatus [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25746852) it's unclear how common or uncommon they are. Although similar compounds have been found in the fruiting bodies of other mushrooms, at least for the time being they have only been isolated in mycelium for Lion's mane.

###Polysaccharides

By weight dried lion's mane is about 60-80% polysaccharides. B-glucans,A-glucans and glucan-protein complexes are the main representative polysaccharides. Lion Mane's polysaccharides are found disproportionately in the fruiting body, but are also found in the myclia. The polysaccharides in lion's mane have many possible benefits, including immunomodulation and anti-diabetic effects. Some evidence suggests polysaccharides from lion's mane may have neuroprotective effects against amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity. [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266872)

###Sterols

Erinarols J a compound found in the methanol extract of the fruiting body of lion's mane exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects. It was shown to reduce TNF-alpha and nitric oxide production in the presence of lipopolysaccharide. [[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794894)

##Lion's Mane Trials

*[Improving effects of the mushroom Yamabushitake (Hericium erinaceus) on mild cognitive impairment: a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18844328)*

*[Improvement of cognitive functions by oral intake of Hericium erinaceus.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413233)*

What was used: 0.8 grams of a powdered fruiting body

##Conclusion

Lion's Mane is a mushroom with a wide range of possible benefits. The compounds responsible for the potential benefits are distributed throughout the mushroom, the fruiting body and the mycelium. Special extracts and processes are probably not necessary and not warranted by the research, the main trial that ignited the recent interest in Lion's Mane simply used dried mushroom powder, other recent trials used a mix of fruiting body and mycelia extracts or simply a fruiting body extract. Erinacines are found in the fruiting body and the mycelium, Hericenones are found in the fruiting body. There hasn't been enough research to know what is the correct dosages are. There may be an inverted U shaped dose response curve when neuroplasticity is involved (it's possible to get too much and too little for optimal results). 

It's also interesting to see how Lion's Mane ranks subjectively compared to other purported nootropics, since comments may be systematically skewed for or against it. [In terms of overall pleasantness, anxiety, focus, memory, motivation and mood effects, lion's mane isn't close to being the best or the worst nootropic](https://darktka.github.io/). From my perspective Lion's Mane steals attention away from better nootropics because of the headline claim of increasing NGF, but it's not unique there, ALCAR also does the same thing [[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8187841), high quality research on Lion's mane is scarce and the subjective results on average are pretty underwhelming.

TL;DR

There's not enough research to make hard and fast recommendations about how much or what to take if you're interested in Lion's Mane. The safest bet is to eat the fruiting body (actual mushroom) or a powder from the fruiting body, which would mimic the protocol from the main Lion's mane study and its traditional use. But Lion's mane is confusing and there's a lot of false information and shady companies out there because the research is not conclusive, which is a problem in itself.

For an idea of what it would cost to eat 3 grams of dried lion's mane per day I looked what dried lion's mane was going for on the internet. I found a place that sells it for 33 dollars a pound, 1 pound has 453 grams. To replicate the study you'd need 3 grams per day, so that means that 33 dollars gives you a 151 day supply (about 5 months). 33/151 = 21 cents per day. It's actually an affordable experiment, if you're curious.

Uridine Monophosphate - A warning (May have destroyed my own brain),278,cgr1uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cgr1uo/uridine_monophosphate_a_warning_may_have/,178,1563907772.0,"Hey r/nootropics, long time lurker here. Just wanted to present a warning to others when it comes to supplementing Uridine Monophosphate.

As someone who has struggled severely with poor motivation, apathy and anergia, who comes from a familial background of underachievement, and who wished to avoid being trapped within that same cycle; I have like many on this sub-reddit experimented with supplementation, excercise and diet alteration seeking to ameliorate some of the seemingly hereditary performance inhibitors that have hampered my personal success and happiness.

So around the summer of 2018 I was set to begin a computer science course, and having browsed this sub-reddit came across threads discussing the therapeutic benefits of Uridine Monophosphate supplementation, and the reports appeared to be glowing. It seemed the perfect supplement to experiment with, with clinical trials seemingly supporting it's effectiveness in boosting cognition and motivation, promoting dopamine up-regulation, having positive cholinergic effects, with a strong safety profile.

And so, having acquired some in capsule form, I began supplementation, whilst I didn't have a source of Alpha-GPC, I ate a diet heavy in choline, to attempt to produce a similar effect.
And sufficed to say I noticed results quickly, I increased my daily dose from 350mg to 750mg orally , then from 175mg to 350mg sub-lingually, with entirely positive results, mood was enhanced significantly, my memory was notably enhanced, in particular long term recall and information encoding, my brain fog lifted, with complex problems now seeming trivial, I was far more confident in social situations and my work on my course was fantastic. In truth, it was a tremendous period of my life, full of passion and pleasure, and I felt as if I'd rediscovered my long lost childhood fervour for learning.

Eventually, having massively increased my workload, I dialled back the uridine supplementation, the gym work and the choline heavy diet, figuring that should my mood decline, I would return to my previous state, and pick the supplementation back up.
Eventually I ran out of my uridine supply, and opted not to purchase any more, frankly, I felt so changed as a person that a return to an altered mood state seemed impossible.

And that's when my problems began, it's somewhat of a horror story.

1) I noticed a decrease in my sleep time and quality, ascribing it to my heavy workload, I began a regime of increased sleep hygiene, to little effect.

2) I began to experience lethalogica, the ""tip of the tongue"" phenomenon, something I rarely experienced. It began infrequently, but soon occurred on several occasions per hour, my verbal fluency declined significantly, and it felt as if holes were being punched in my vocabulary.

3) Work I'd found easy just 6 weeks prior began to become difficult and intimidating.

4) My mood dropped, my passion diminished.

5) Suddenly I was struck by this seemingly pervasive processing deficiency, the world seemed to become ""flat"" and distant, the autonomic retrieval of information pertaining to objects seen the in the world seemed to dissappear.

6) I started to make simple mistakes, things such as not indicating whilst driving, I began to notice that I could no longer quickly verbally elucidate my thought processes whilst performing tasks like this, whereas previously I could do so comfortably.

7) I began suffering from an unrelenting fatigue that did not alleviate with sleep.

And then began the ""event"", the most awful and harrowing experience I have ever suffered and would not wish upon even the most despicable denizens of hell, I won't go into too much detail, but in short I was awake for six days, cycling between panicked excitability and an absolutely abject insufferable terror, which resulted in several trips to doctors, A&E and eventually  self imposed informal admission to psychiatric hospital. 

I was discharged on the 24th of December and have yet to make anything near a full recovery.

I no longer felt capable of completing my course, and eventually withdrew, and have been incapable of working since.

I suffer still from the persistent fatigue, my sleep is entirely unrefreshing, my brain is no longer functional in any real sense, I have fine movement tremors across my entire body, and feel some sort of jolting motion through my torso when I lie down. Whilst my doctors repeatadely insist I'm just ""depressed"" frankly I feel like I'm suffering from some sort of dementia.

Now I'm aware that all of these symptoms cannot be definitively demonstrated to be a result of the uridine supplementation and cessation, but the dramatic nature and short timescale of the alteration suggests a neurochemical effect.

Just thought I'd share my story.",2019-07-23 14:49:32

Don't underestimate cardio,277,8m4tyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8m4tyj/dont_underestimate_cardio/,90,1527308573.0,"I've been a long time nootropics ""hobbyist"" if you will and I've tried close to everything. There are many supplements I swear by and take daily that have given me noticeable improvements like polygala, panax ginseng, black seed oil, ashwagandha, cordyceps, shilajit, noopept, piracetam, etc but a couple months ago I picked up cycling again after not being on a bike for over 2 years (partially due to a knee injury, partially just laziness) and although everyone knows how good cardio is for the brain it's often overlooked.

 It was tough at first and I found myself gasping for air and taking frequent breaks, but I persevered and after a couple weeks I started getting in better shape. I was amazed at how damn good I felt after cycling for 30 minutes to an hour. I get some euphoria, my mind speeds up and I obtain a clear headedness that beats any nootropic I've tried. The mild euphoria lasts for several hours and my brain just feels ""on"" for the rest of the day. 

I become more socially adept and confident partially due to the immediate benefits of exercise and partially due to getting in better shape and looking better over time. Now anytime I have something important coming up like a date, social event or even ranked MOBA gameplay I get my cycling in beforehand and it truly helps. I've also lost a considerable amount of weight, and through improving my diet and increasing my protein intake dramatically have gained muscle at the same time. I still take my noots of course, and I'm sure the exercise compounds their effects but I just wanted to share my experience with you guys because cycling really has helped me tremendously by improving my mood, focus, memory, sociability, confidence, health and physique.

Caffine + L-theanine is absolutely magical for me. What could I do to try and bring my baseline nearer to it?,272,fpvg94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/fpvg94/caffine_ltheanine_is_absolutely_magical_for_me/,147,1585337918.0,"Hi!

I'm once again struck by just how phenomnenally effective this combo is for me - I try not to drink coffee too often lest I grow a tolerance to it, but whenever I do the wave of optimism, focus, and productivity astounds me. It is a telling anecdote that the morning went by largely unnoticed, spent mostly drifting in thought or on the internet intermixed with a couple spurts of activity, and that fifteen minutes after drinking a shot of espresso mixed with half a gram of l-theanine (a fifteen minutes that went by very much lost in thought, unaware, basically forgetting I had even drank it) I found myself cleaning the kitchen, buzzed about the various things I am making progress on in life.

My lifestyle is semi sedentary, I have a pretty solid mindfulness habit, and I eat a fairly varied diet with a strong sleeping schedule that ensures 8 hours of rest each day.

Yet, without caffeine, I struggle significantly from a general lack of... energy, motion, momentum. Getting going is hard, sustaining movement is far from effortless, and stopping is easy.

What would be the lowest hanging fruit in terms of getting even a bit closer to the caffeine high in my normal life? Should I just embrace caffeine further (as I recall some effects one does not grow a tolerance to), explore some of the caffeine alternatives, increase exercise or try something else? Very open to advice or general discussion on the topic, as this ""lack of energy"" is very much the biggest challenge I grapple with each day - and undoubtedly one some others here will relate to also.

&#x200B;

Gathering some of the common themes from the replies below:

1. Get moving, you lazy bum!- various theories as to why, from dopamine upregulation to tricking your body into believing higher energy levels are necessary to more abstract ideas around ""staying in motion""< Yup, I probably should. I have tried a few times in the past, but the energy slump I experience a few minutes after execise makes it very hard to really ""snowball"" the habit in a meaningful way.
2. Meditate the tiredness awayOn it, about 20min a day is my norm.
3. Nature, baby!< I go for a walk almost every day, about 15-30 minutes long, in a forest nearby. I enjoy it, it's partly an additional mindfulness exercise for me as well, but the same slump as from exercise hits about as soon as I get indoors.
4. Supplements - it's turtles all the way down! :D- I knew the subreddit I was posting this in, so no surprises here.
5. Quite a few people suggest switching away from coffee to some other caffeinated herb - must say I don't fully understand why. I sometimes drink coffee, other times I drink (lots of) tea or mate. The effects seem very similar to me.
6. Uridine is something I am right now trialling, with no clear effect so far.
7. One person noted it could be a norepinephrine issue, which in some ways resonates with me - I definitely enjoy being near deadlines, the tiredness just melts away. So far I've just not found any replacement for deadlines :D.
8. Caffeine dependence is something many suggest or imply as a problem. Been through a 2-week reset, now taking less than 200mg/week, concentrated on one or two days. So I'm not exactly guzzling the stuff.
9. A couple voices suggest just giving in to caffeine dependence, that it does retain some of its effects. It frustrates me that info on caffeine tolerance is so scarce, despite it being something that should surely be impacting almost all of us - afterall, caffeine is the one nootropic that almost everyone agrees genuinely, tangibly works.
10. One person noted that this could be a case of undiagnosed adult ADHD, which definitely felt counterintuitive at first. However, upon closer examination (and time taken to get past the popular idea of what the disorder is) this could indeed be more of a symptom of inhibition control: following impulses and stimuli, struggling to orient one's behaviour towards distinct goals (in my above description, ""morning went by largely unnoticed, spent mostly drifting in thought or on the internet""). A number of other possible signs are there, so I've made an appointment with a neurologist who specialises in adult ADHD to explore this avenue as well. Can't hurt.

I know that L-Theanine doesn't work for everyone but if it does here's some information that may improve your experience.

&#x200B;

Current routine looks like this:

* 40-50mg L-Theanine + a double espresso + 2 cups of water in the morning. (Always drink water, you body and brain needs it!)
* No other nootropics/drugs, no alcohol

&#x200B;

Dosage effects:

* 40-50mg Gives me a good mood in the morning, i have patience with people and i can articulate myself better. That is because it makes me more calm and my mind is not racing.
* 100-150mg It acts more like a beta blocker as in more like an emotion suppressor. Personally i use only for public speaking which i hate but otherwise i avoid because of the ""zombie"" like feeling.
* 200mg+ Brain fog

&#x200B;

Side effects:

* Might lower your libido. Depending on the dosage.

&#x200B;

Notes:

* Taking L-Theanine before sleep or evening for that matter is a no-no. It may seem to help with sleep but it prevents you from going into deep sleep. At least that's my experience.
* No tolerance. Same effects every time.
* Too much = brain fog. Find how much your body can process.
* I use powder form, easier to control dosages.
* Empty stomach or not, makes no difference for me (true for powder form, pills might be different).

&#x200B;

Overall, i'd consider L-Theanine a great addition to your morning coffee routine. Benefits is that you get a nice calming effect that lasts almost all day.Not a medical opinion, but in higher dosages it might help with severe anxiety.",2019-07-13 23:07:56

Small app that simply adjusts the color temperature of your screen slowly as the night falls so you don't have a little sun in your room frying your retinas all night.

During the day, computer screens look good—they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun.

f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.

It's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your screen look better.

This is known, though, and mostly obvious that people with cancer should not use BPC-157.

I have recently seen here people discussing whether it is safe or not to use BPC-157 eye drops. While there are no specific studies about it, it's important to remember BPC-157 is a very direct inducer of angiogenesis, and when it is applied locally to the eye it might cause excessive angiogenesis there that it wouldn't cause with other routes of administration.

Excessive angiogenesis in the eye can cause bleeding in the retina, which can lead to permanent, partial or complete, blindness^[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12597922) . This is a known issue with diabetes (diabetic retinopathy).

This is much less of a concern, if any at all, when BPC-157 is administered orally or by a Sub-Q injection, since it shouldn't reach the eye in any significant concentrations to matter.

The prefrontal cortices and the reward system — the **ventral tegementum** (referred to as the **VTA**) and the **nucleus accumbens** (referred to as the **NAc**)— are wired together in a loop of two-way communication. 

The **VTA** sends signals to the **PFC** through the **NAc** to remember sequences of behavior which produce positive or negative results, and the **PFC** can send signals back to the **NAc** and **VTA** to express the impulse and carry out the behavior, or to inhibit the impulse and leave the itch of desire unfulfilled (this is a simplistic description but adequate.) In addiction, from compulsive behaviors to drug addiction of all stripes, this pathway becomes altered. 

The **PFC**’s ability to inhibit reward pathways that have been very strongly reinforced, such as those fed by cannabis use, is lessened, creating the behavioral loop of wanting to stop, knowing you need to stop, but finding yourself unable to stop even when you try.

N-acetylcysteine is most widely known as an antioxidant, as it is a precursor to one of the body’s master antioxidants. It is the first-line treatment for acetaminophen/Tylenol overdose, as it is able to neutralize the toxic metabolites and protect the liver and organ systems from damage. 

In recent decades, research on NAC has revealed that it has very promising psychiatric effects as well. NAC has been demonstrated to have pronounced and varied benefits in a host of psychiatric and psychological conditions such as compulsive gambling, addiction, OCD, ADHD, bipolar disorders 1 and 2, schizophrenia, without demonstrable negative side effects or counter-indications. [N-acetylcysteine in psychiatry: current therapeutic evidence and potential mechanisms of action](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044191/)

The relevant effects of NAC on cannabis dependence are a result of its effects on a neurotransmitter called glutamate. While dopamine and other neurotransmitters flavor the messages of neurotransmission, glutamate is the ultimate messenger. NAC decreases glutamate activity in pathways between the **VTA** and **NAc** to the **PFC**, which results in pronounced reductions in craving and relapse behaviors. Where willpower fails, NAC can step in and create breathing room without creating further dependence to another drug.

The long-term benefits of NAC are concurrent to the short-term benefits. The reduction in **NAc**-**PFC** communication allows the heavily reinforced pathways to atrophy, freeing up the reward system’s capacity and allowing it to be diverted elsewhere towards healthier behaviors. Neurons that fire together wire together, and so pathways that have received a large amount of activity will be more heavily reinforced than others. Just as increased activity increases the strength of the pathway, reduced activity decreases the strength of the overactive pathways with time. 

The implications for us? NAC gives us breathing room in which to exercise our willpower and reinforce the behaviors we want to pursue to better ourselves, rather than the behaviors we are helpless to stop engaging in, such as cannabis use. Long-term NAC use will not only reduce cravings and relapse behaviors, but help normalize our reward system, and spread our reward capacity to the finer pleasures in life beyond the blunt instrument of cannabis use. 

The paper I cited even reviews a study of NAC’s use in cannabis dependence:

&amp;amp;gt;Marijuana dependence: A recent study by Gray and colleagues investigated the use of NAC (2400 mg/d) in an open-label study of 24 dependent marijuana users who reported an interest in reducing their use. Following treatment, users reported reductions in days/week of use and “number of hits.”

Here is another quote from the study mentioned:

&amp;amp;gt;N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to reverse drug-induced down-regulation of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, which presumably allows for regulation of glutamate release, reducing compulsive drug-seeking be- haviors. Consistent with this, preliminary studies have demonstrated significant reductions in cocaine craving and cigarette use during NAC treatment. Taken together, these findings implicate NAC as a potential treatment for addictive disorders, including cannabis dependence. Thus, the purpose of this open-label study was to gather tolerability and preliminary efficacy data for NAC in the treatment of cannabis dependence in young people.

[N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) in Young Marijuana Users: An Open-Label Pilot Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826714/)

There are other benefits. NAC has strong antioxidant activity, protecting mitochondria in the brain from toxic byproducts of metabolism, as well as pronounced anti-inflammatory activity in the body and brain, reducing the load of chronic inflammation from poor lifestyle and allergies. It is known that chronic inflammation alters dopamine activity in the reward system, negatively affecting willpower. With this in mind, the benefits of NAC are robust: it targets pathological coping mechanisms from multiple angles, and normalizes reward system activity to increase willpower and diminish cravings and compulsive behaviors such as cannabis use. 

[Can’t or Won’t? Immunometabolic Constraints on Dopaminergic Drive](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30066-X)

NAC is a tool that has helped me, and it can certainly help many of you. I find that the constant itch of craving — for cannabis, and for other comforting coping mechanisms — gets quieter. Rather than becoming obsessed with hypotheticals to pursue pleasure, my mind is much more at ease with the novelties of the present moment. The breeze on my skin, the birds chirping, the rustling of branches and leaves in the forest have a magic that is easily forgotten, but similarly inviting to rediscover. When we can pull ourselves away from the cycle of craving and satiation of dependence on cannabis or any other source of comfort for that matter, we are able to re-enter the present and rediscover what we knew as kids.

I take three 600 milligram tablets of sustained-release NAC first thing in the morning. I feel the clarity and coolness come on within half an hour, and it lasts for the entire day with this dose. I felt this effect the first time I used this dosage of NAC, back in October of 2018, and I still feel the same effect today. While my use has shifted away from cannabis abstinence as I’ve recovered, I find that it helps address my anxiety, ADHD, and residual post-concussion symptom symptoms, which greatly increases my quality of life. 

For context, I’m an eighteen year old guy who has had difficulty with anxiety, ADHD, and compulsive reward behavior all my life, and in the past four years since I discovered cannabis, I have struggled to moderate myself and remain stable, especially after the string of six concussions I received, the last nearly a year ago. NAC and other supplements, alongside weekly therapy and a wholesale-healthy lifestyle, have helped nurse me back to health, and given me the strength and support I needed to thrive.

I use the Whole Foods brand ($20 for 100 tablets, $.20/tablet) because it is most convenient for me, but Jarrow’s NAC sustained release ($18.17 for 100 tablets, $.18/tablet) is of comparable or even better quality at a better price point. 

I hope this helps someone out there in some way. Cheers! :)

Edit: An important note that has been made in the comments that I must add:

While NAC has certainly contributed to a number of positive changes in my life, **it has not been the sole factor.** I’ve had the support of a psychiatrist who knows me and my conditions very well and with whom I research and discuss the mechanisms underlying my various conditions as well as the different pharmacotherapies, prescription and OTC/supplemental, which are available and show promise. I’ve also had the support and guidance of a therapist with whom I have worked for more than sixteen months now. Nothing is an instant fix, certainly. Take my experience with a grain of salt, reader, as our situations most certainly vary. I am also 18, and have had a strong emotional attachment to my health and well-being, so my perspective is definitely myopic in some regards.",2019-06-27 19:10:00

Struggling with brainfog/depression/anxiety? Succes story (long post),271,brc8wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/brc8wz/struggling_with_brainfogdepressionanxiety_succes/,162,1558483638.0,"This community here on reddit is amazing and I would like to say 'thank You' by sharing my story and hopefully my experience will help other people.

I'm an 18 year old guy, one of my nr 1 'life rules' has been to be healthy, both in diet and physically (since I was 12 year old). My diet has been extremely clean for the past few years and I do calisthenics (bodyweight workouts) on daily basis.

Although my diet was great and I always looked strong and healthy.. I had some serious issues with my mental health (cognitive function) pretty much ever since I entered the puberty. 

I didn't had any traumatic experience when I was young or negative thoughts that led me to depression.. 

This brainfog was a mix of uncontrolled depression and anxiety that was always present in my life (started when I was 14).. but every year, I would get a 'season' of extreme depression and extreme anxiety which often led me to stay in bed for weeks or even months.

This seasonal crap didn't happened just in winter or just in summer (it wasn't a seasonal depression), it happened at ANY time and could last throughout the whole summer till winter or even longer. 

After a while.. I seriously started to worry. I have a girlfriend and we plan to have a future together and I just COULDN'T feel this way anymore..

My symptoms were: anxiety, chronic fatigue, depression, mood swing, sensitivity to pain/light/loud sounds, no libido.. one word: HELL

I would never end my life.. but after experiencing this.. I understood why some people do 

It felt as if my body or brain couldn't handle life anymore.. while I am truly one of the luckiest people alive.. I have a great/supportive family, an amazing girlfriend (soon wife), great plans for the future, ALWAYS been full of joy and optimism..

But I was literally dying inside. 

I decided that this is it, I won't give up on life without fighting for it.. 

I visited waaaay too many doctors.. who took blood tests (for everything) that always came back perfect. They said that I 'stress too much about my brainfog.. which just makes it even worse'.. they recommended me to practice some meditation and yoga (great tip)... that's exactly what I wanted and needed to hear at the darkest times of my life. 

I took things into my own hands, didn't gave a sht about doctors and started to look into /nootropics on reddit, herbs and natural supplements 

I started to see some light on the end of the dark tunnel that I've been in for sooo long. I started to read people's experiences EVERY day (it became my new hobby) and I ordered some suplements. 

I bought:
- Magnesium (mineral) 
- Black seed oil (seed oil) 
- Ashwagandha (herb/root powder) 
- Rhodiola Rosea (herb/root powder) 

This is how I'm feeling after about JUST 2 weeks of supplementing:

- energy improved, I sleep MUCH less and feel amazing 
- no more depression 
- no more brainfog/memory/focus issues 
- anxiety.. GONE 
- great mood throughout the whole day 
- my social life improved DRASTICALLY.. due to my new mental clarity, better memory and focus
- I'm stable, feeling grounded and confident af
- my libido is through the roof (probably due to the ashwagandha).. me and my girl have had so much fun lately 

I went from a zombie to a freaking superman!!!! 

I'm not PROMOTING ANYTHING 

It's UNBELIEVABLE how I feel now.. maybe it was just a magnesium deficiency or maybe the black seed oil known for 'cure for everything except death' healed something that my doctors couldn't diagnose.. 

Anyways.. this stuff is amazing and everyone who's struggling with mental health for no known reasons, should REALLY consider trying these amazing supplements 

I just want to thank YOU all the people here on this community and I would be sooo happy if someone else could fix things they struggle with on daily basis like I did..

My daily doses:
- Magnesium: 1250mg a day
- Black seed oil: 3g in the morning and 3g in the evening 
- Ashwagandha (root powder): 4,5g in the morning 
- Rhodiola Rosea (root powder): 500/1000mg a day 

If You have any questions.. feel open to ask about anything and good luck on Your journey to a better, healthier and happier life.

Edit:
I see many people mention here bipolar disorder, mania etc.. You need to understand that I'm not feeling like I'm high on some drugs, I'm feeling like I'm back to my NORMALSELF. This is how every other 18 year old should feel like.. mental clarity and feeling energetic. It's like being an 80 year old grandpa (I literally felt like that) and going back to youth where u had energy to be outside all day long.. 

Thank u for all the support tho!!",2019-05-21 20:07:18
Baking soda makes me feel great,269,e028lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/e028lf/baking_soda_makes_me_feel_great/,258,1574464218.0,"I've been on a multi-year quest to figure out exactly why I deal with my odd chronic fatigue symptoms and recently I made a breakthrough. Out of all the energy drinks, Red Bull seems to be the only one that actually makes me feel alright. I started going through the ingredients, trying them on their own and eventually, I worked my way up to freaking baking soda. I've been taking a little arm & hammer box with me to work daily and I just took 2 teaspoons with some water. My brain fog feels like it's melting away and I can focus much easier. Almost every day 3ish hours after lunch I experience intense brain fog and anxiety and it helps eat through that as well (a real game-changer)

From what I've read, sodium bicarbonate can help correct the lower pH in blood from your body's byproducts such as lactic acid buildup from exercise leading to increased performance, or even ketones from burning excessive fat. Speaking of ketones, MCT oil used to give me the WORST crippling brain fog. If I take a teaspoon of baking soda along with the MCT oil I get NO FOG whatsoever and it actually works intended. 

I'm actually a little concerned that this may be indicative of a disorder I've got going on, but I can't narrow it down to anything. Is it's effectiveness something I need to be worried about?",2019-11-22 18:10:18

ALCAR (Acetyl L-Carnitine) and the NMDA receptor; Memory problems and Marijuana abuse,267,a1xpx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a1xpx2/alcar_acetyl_lcarnitine_and_the_nmda_receptor/,84,1543649593.0,"I've just discovered some information that I think is valuable enough to share, specifically if you are concerned about the memory problems you're experiencing due to chronic marijuana use/abuse. The mechanism by which chronic marijuana use causes memory problems is the internalization of the CB1 receptor, the same mechanism which causes tolerance to marijuana in the first place. When the CB1 receptor is internalized into the cell, other receptors associated with it will follow, most notably the NMDA receptor, and while these receptors are in the cell they are unable to carry out functions associated with their activation (These are proven and real effects, read more here https://examine.com/nutrition/the-unbiased-truth-about-marijuana/). When it comes to memory problems, this internalization of the NMDA receptor is extremely important. It is known that there is an overall decrease in NMDA receptors as people age, and lower NMDA receptor levels have been implicated in hindering memory function, learning ability, and synaptic plasticity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703758/). NMDA receptor dysfunction/loss is found to a high degree in Alzheimer's patients.

Here's where the role of Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) comes in. I found several studies that document an increase in NMDA receptors in the brain following ALCAR treatments. 
>Acute i.p. administration of Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), a component of several biological systems, has been found to modify spontaneous and evoked electrocortical activity in young rats, and, in the old rats, to improve learning ability and to **increase the number of NMDA receptors in the whole brain.**

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7969747/

>Aging is associated with a reduction in the maximal density of NMDA-sensitive glutamate binding sites in rat hippocampus. This reduction is attenuated after long-term administration with L-acetylcarnitine (10 mg/Kg i.p. once a day for 4 months)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2557734/?i=3&from=/7969747/related

Now, if you're like me and you find yourself addicted to lots of weed (or maybe you smoke every day but you can stop whenever you want, whatever), and you're starting to experience undeniable and unignorable memory deficits, this data seems to indicate that ALCAR can solve the memory issues caused by NMDA receptor internalization, by either increasing total number of NMDA receptors, attenuating their decline caused by excessive marijuana use, or both. I'm interested to see feedback on this information, personally I've been taking ALCAR for a few days and aside from the increases in attention and energy I'm seeing a noticable benefit in long and short term memory, the latter of which has seen a much more drastic increase, while cutting my marijuana consumption by about a third.",2018-12-01 02:33:13

I have no work ethic, I do the absolute least possible on everything I can. I just finished my master in computer science and I gained no work ethic at all from it.

I don't think I'm depressed, I'm quite happy most of the time, I'm also super shy but I become super happy and sociable when I'm drunk, my friends appreciate that about me but I always wanted to be more productive and sociable in my normal life.

Well a few years ago I discovered modafinil and I bought some online, it actually worked a bit but I wasn't spending time on the right thing, it would make me compare every laptop possible to see what's the best one at each price point or some other shit like that for hours instead of making me study more so I stopped taking it.

Recently I had accumulated so much thing to do, my apartment was a total mess, I didn't take out the trash for months, I couldn't even go on my balcony anymore, I was literally losing money because I was too lazy to cancel some subscriptions and I ghosted some interviewers for jobs I wanted to do and many other things.

At this point, I decided to take one artvigil with one pill of caffeine which I read was a good combination. Well I'm happy I did that because I had the most productive day of my whole life, my apartment is spotless, I did everything I should have done for months in only one day, I actually called to cancel my old internet subscription without being stressed, (for me calling is the worst, it makes me stressed as fuck and I have to prepare mentally for hours or days, well not this time)

The only problem is that when I'm under the effect of artvigil (and caffeine this time) I lose one trait of my personality that I like, I'm the least stressed person ever, nothing stress me (except calling or meeting someone I don't know) and my days are peaceful. Under the effect I can feel my body being a lot more twitchy, I don't know how to explain it but I need to do something and sometimes it's annoying but I like everything else, my mind is also a lot less heavy and I just do things without thinking too much about it.

Also when I'm not under the effect, I think about writing stuff like that on reddit but I never do it, now I'm under the effect for an other productive day and I'm finally motivated enough to write that down, I don't really mind if nobody reply to this post but I needed to write it for a long time, I have more to tell but I don't want this post to be too long.

If you have a similar story or if you want to comment about something I would be more than happy to exchange with you.

Thank you for reading.

Sorry if I didn't reply yet to you, it's quite a lot to read and I also try to be productive with other things at the same time :) Thank you all!",2019-09-10 16:38:51

Nicotine has harmed more than it has helped,261,f7hpoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/f7hpoc/nicotine_has_harmed_more_than_it_has_helped/,160,1582348096.0,"Hey y'all,

I thought I would share my experience with nicotine as a nootropic to hopefully help save others similar to myself from wasting their time (in more than a few ways).

**TL;DR/Take home message:** If you have even the tiniest bit of an addictive personality, then I'd strongly advise staying away from nicotine entirely. It's a powerful drug and should be treated as such. If you're going to try it anyway then I'd recommend to reserve it for very occasional use; once a week tops. I'd had much better improvements in cognition, motivation, conscientiousness and even mornings with meditation, exercise and a good diet than I've had with this. If you do/can use it very occasionally as a nootropic, then good for you; my experience is that it made things worse. The articles, top 10 nootropic lists, etc. I'd read before did mention the addictive nature of it, but I thought I'd be ok. They DID NOT mention increases in impulsivity re: using nicotine; this increased impulsivity negated any gains.

**Starting**  
I had stopped smoking about 12 years ago. About 1.5 years ago I had a resurgent interest in nootropics. Looking through a few web articles, many of them recommended nicotine. I'd stopped years ago due to health concerns and the lack of nicotine replacement options, so thought I might give it a try. My initial intention was to use it for productivity, to help with reading/writing/academia.

**Initial** **Use**  
Initial findings were understandably/obviously pleasant (due to the highly dopaminergic nature of the drug). I was only using occasionally (keeping to initial intention). I'd use a mouth spray. Occasionally turned into regularly: a few in the morning, then after meals, and more in the evening if I was having a drink. I've alway struggled with mornings, and this was one of the first times I felt there was a quick fix for that morning grogginess.

**Escalation**  
Usage escalated very quickly to the point where I was using the mouth spray around the clock. Further, it meant that 1 glass of wine in the evening turned into 2, and sometimes 3, because the pairing of depressant and stimulant of the two was so enjoyable; more drinking meant more nicotine, etc.

**Quitting**  
Not only was I NOT more productive re: nicotine, I was actually LESS productive and more impulsive. Whatever gains I was getting re: dopamine/motivation and acetylcholine/cognition were hugely impaired by increasing impulsivity, etc (backed up by studies below). That, and I was drinking more. So, I decided to quit.

**Nicotine and Impulsivity**  
""Nicotine increases impulsivity and decreases willingness to exert cognitive effort despite improving attention in ""slacker"" rats"" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25353339](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25353339)""Exposure to nicotine vapor causes short-term increases in impulsive choice in rats""[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/842005v2.full](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/842005v2.full)""Effects of acute and chronic nicotine on impulsive choice in rats""[https://insights.ovid.com/behavioural-pharmacology/bepha/2005/02/000/effects-acute-chronic-nicotine-impulsive-choice/2/00008877](https://insights.ovid.com/behavioural-pharmacology/bepha/2005/02/000/effects-acute-chronic-nicotine-impulsive-choice/2/00008877)

Quitting was hell, which I guess makes sense going from using something around the clock to stopping entirely. The time I've lost re: nicotine: lost productivity due to increased impulsivity; weeks out of my schedule due to quitting down time. Save yourself the trouble and don't start.",2020-02-22 00:08:16
Experiments without a doctor are dangerous. My friend killed himself,261,6hz0mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6hz0mg/experiments_without_a_doctor_are_dangerous_my/,121,1497810708.0,"I had a best friend, we talked with him every day for 9 years. /user/BerserkerGreaves/


We have always had a mild depression, but last year it has intensified. However, the reason for each was different. I have brain damage. He lacks a girl, few friends, problems with his family, migraine, a bad city of habitation and other. We both found this sub on the reddit and began to try the substances to help ourselves.


He tried everything, even microdosing. He also drank antidepressants and I constantly said that he should discuss everything with the doctor. 3 days ago in the evening he said that he had completely cured depression and that there had never been such a condition, he had many plans for future. And in the morning of next day he wrote a farewell letter, swallowed all the pills and died from cardiac arrest.


I feel guilty and will never be able to forgive myself.
With this theme I wanted to say that it's very dangerous to drink drugs without a doctor. I also note that in this subreddit, more depression is treated than cognitive problems, but cure depression without a doctor is too dangerous.
Discuss, please, all with the physician.

Most of us have taken Tianeptine. Some of us rely on it to function in our social, educational, and professional careers. We know the profound effect it can have on individuals. We would never want it to be banned. I would be mortified if it were banned. I personally do not know what I what do. 
 
 Kratom is a similar substance. It hits the mu-opioid receptors. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people rely on it everyday just like they do on tianeptine. Personally I notice very little difference between these two substances except for the duration of effect. Ceretropics sulphate version is longer.

Threats from Brainstorm Nootropics / PowerFocus,248,4nnf61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4nnf61/threats_from_brainstorm_nootropics_powerfocus/,94,1465710515.0,"Some of you may have seen the new vendor post about a week ago for a new product called PowerFocus, from Brainpower Nootropics . The owner has deleted it now, but you can see the comments in the link below; minus the comments from the owner, which have either been edited or deleted.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4m6mpf/feedback_on_this_nootropic/

Now many of you know that I can be very critical of new companies that pop up with unfounded claims, over the top marketing, fake reviews, no purity testing, dangerous ingredients, etc. Lately others have been starting to jump in and question things too, which is a good thing. It shows that people are starting to push for higher standards in the industry. Admittedly, I can be a bit direct in some of my criticisms. Some may even call me an asshole. However, I do it because I care about the community and the people in it. The fact that it seems like a new company selling a nootropic stack pops up every week, makes these criticisms more frequent. I want this community to be safer, grow, and advance. New vendors creating quality products, doing proper testing, and not over-marketing the shit out of things, is the way to do that. We have some really good vendors, that bring out novel quality products, and treat safety the way it should be treated. But like any other growing industry, we have a ton of people getting into it just to make money. Those are the ones that need to be called out.

Now to the direct issue of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus. Their stack was called out by a few people for a number of reasons. The most glaring of them is the fact that they claim to have almost 3 grams powders per serving, but you cannot physically fit that amount into two 00 capsules. Anybody that works with 00 capsules can immediately know something is up with those numbers. They also did not know what a COA was when asked, along with a few other issues. All very valid things to call a vendor out on. The big issue, and the reason I made this post, is that after those criticisms were raised, the owner of the company decided to threaten me with retribution if I did not delete my comments. This is a very serious issue, and needs to be addressed.

I've been threatened a few times now by other vendors, and some have even followed through on those threats, and have caused issues for me. It happens to me a lot because of how vocal I am about ridiculous things I see, and the fact that I am an easier target to lash out at. However, nobody should fear retribution from vendors for calling them out on things they see wrong. Vendors threatening any members of this community is unacceptable, but it is more common than many think. Other moderators have been threatened. Other Redditors have as well. It something that needs to be addressed. I'll provide evidence of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus's threats below, along with evidence of him following through with those threats.

[Here is the email we received from the owner of Brainpower Nootropics yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/suFrK7f.jpg)

[Here is the Facebook message threat sent around the same time.](http://i.imgur.com/inM7RNW.jpg)

Apparently someone made a bad review of their product on Amazon after their launch post, and he thought it was me. It's obviously not me, but he felt it necessary to threaten me all the same. At first I just decided to ignore it. I thought he would drop it after he vented his frustration with his little idle threat, and that would be it. However, then he decided to step the game up to libel and defamation, by writing a review on our Facebook wall saying that he almost died from one of our products. That took it from an idle threat, to an actual crime. 

[Here is his ""review"" on our page.](http://i.imgur.com/SAubiEg.jpg)

This is obviously unacceptable, and I will be contacting the Leeds police department in the UK to discuss it with them. UK libel and defamation laws are a lot more strict, and him using his real personal Facebook page makes it pretty easy to link. Making fake reviews, of almost dying no less, is not just something that the community cannot tolerate. It is an actual crime. To be clear, we will not accept vendors threatening anyone for expressing their opinions on this forum, nor anyone making threats of any kind. If a vendor threatens you, please contact us moderators, and we will help deal with it.

But the results have been so stunning I couldn't wait.

I came to Semax after [reading this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/b603zg/what_semax_did_for_me/?st=jvi65pk9&sh=9b146327) 

I'm 16 months clean from hard drugs and six months clean and sober. I've meditated, exercised, eaten well, worked the steps, volunteered, gotten into therapy... done everything you're supposed to do in recovery. But Semax is the only thing that's worked for me for anxiety, low mood, and anhedonia. Here is my log:

------------------
SEMAX LOG
Day 0:
I score 12 points on the depression self assessment and 11 points on the anxiety self assessment.
I am often tired, depressed and anxious. On weekends I sleep 14-18 hours a day. I have lots of trouble enjoying things I used to enjoy before I entered recovery (art, music, movies, writing, volunteering).
I have issues with crowds and worrying and am definitely ANHEDONIC. It’s been over 15 months without drugs at this point.

Day 1:
Last night I took 1,000 mcg of semax when I got home. 500mcg or 3ml drop of 1% solution in each nostril. 
I was surprised to feel effects almost immediately, with the “fog” leaving me and a focus settling in.
I wouldn’t call that a high but a general feeling of calm, control and wellbeing.
I usually have tons of issues sleeping but I went to bed at 10 last night and woke up at 750. No issues. I feel rested. Still in a good mood.
Think this is a good sign.

Day 2:
Yesterday was such a good day. I think I felt joy for the first time in recovery while I was alone. 
I was at the supermarket eating some chicken, spinach and quinoa and there just-so-happened to be a full brass band playing. During their final song the tubas made a series of melancholy major and minor chords that almost made me tear up.
Definitely made me joyful.
Also – I did so much stuff yesterday:

•	Put away my suitcase

•	Put away my clean clothes

•	Brushed/flossed/mouthwashed twice

•	Emailed two personal trainers

•	Gymed

•	Went grocery shopping

•	Worked on my freelance job and my day job

•	Volunteered at the animal shelter

•	Changed the air filter on the air conditioner

•	Ate 3 healthy meals

•	Tried meditating (for 2 minutes but still)

•	Did this log
I took another 1000mcg today. We’ll see how work is with semax.

Day 3:
I ended up taking 1500 mcg of semax yesterday. It was good, not as good as Sunday but what work day is.
I’m starting to think that semax doesn’t guarantee joy but unlocks the possibility of it
For sure Mondays at my work are stressful and I’m usually spiraling by 2pm.
That did not happen yesterday, I felt some concern, sure but nothing I couldn’t handle.
After work yesterday I booked a personal training session and also walked dogs and went to a recovery meeting.
Here’s to another day.

Day 4:
Yesterday was another good day, very productive day at work. Wrote a training module for new hires that was complicated. Nailed it on the first go.
Took ~2000mcg of semax yesterday (I think).
Met up with a friend for jazz and saw the personal trainer and then cooked myself a nice healthy meal.
No feelings of anhedonia or depression on anxiety like I was feeling.
Negatives: semax at this dose definitely causes headaches late in the day.

Day 5:
It’s the end of my work day and I handled another busy day OK.
Not bursting with joy and good feelings like I was last time but still handling things very well.
Probably just low sleep last night because I went to the movies.
There is definitely a new depth to things there wasn’t before.
I’m able to solve problems with ease and communicate better.
I can interact with other without being wracked by anxiety.
I listen to music and am able to appreciate it creatively and emotionally instead of just mechanically.
I feel like I’m returning to my old self.

Day 6:
I retook the depression and anxiety questionnaire today.
I got a 2 depression score and a 2 anxiety score.
I’m a bit flabbergasted. I know this isn’t the most scientific way to measure the efficacy of semax but holy shit.
I feel like I have a new grit and a new resilience that is allowing me to tackle the days issue without having a breakdown.
And a new perspective that allows me to be able to experience joy, real joy, even if every day isn’t joyful.
Things are good 😊",2019-05-10 18:23:27

It was a complication from having an overactive thyroid (t4 was over 160) and a bladder infection. His elevated BP helped push a blood clot into his brain. 

He couldn't walk at all - he'd fall over with each step and be confused what just happened, but he still tried to get to the food bowl and cat litter and use them.

My awesome vet helped with the thyroid, blood pressure and bladder infection but there was not really anything available to help with the stroke recovery.

I remembered that noopept (GVS-111) was originally designed to treat ischaemia / stroke and other brain injuries and I still had a bottle lying around from a couple of years ago. Seemed like it would be worth a shot? My vet was cautious, but open to anything that might make a difference.

I used the allometric scaling calculator to arrive at a 3mg/day dose schedule. With the help of some small syringes (no tip), I suspended noopept in water and gave him daily oral doses. It was important to start as soon as possible.

By day 3, he was staggering like a drunken sailor, but not falling over. At day 6, he was walking in straight lines and had 90% of his motor function back - he just behaved like a typical older cat.

At 2 weeks, he is not just normal again - he is considerably healthier, happier and more active than he has been for 2 years and thanks to the other medication, he has been putting weight back on again.

Animals are surprisingly resilient, but everyone involved has found this to be rather amazing.

>The researchers found that ***weekly consumption of baked or broiled fish — but not fried fish — was associated with larger gray matter volumes in areas of the brain responsible for memory and cognition, including areas where amyloid plaques, a sign of Alzheimer’s disease, first appear.*** The association persisted after controlling for age, sex, race, education, physical activity, body mass index and any tissue damage found on the initial magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain.

>The ***results were the same regardless of omega-3 levels***, suggesting that omega-3s were not the determining factor. The study appears in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

So its not the DHA, its something else in fish that boosts gray matter. What? I don't know, no one fucking knows. So now I just eat fish.

Sardines are awesome because they are high in healthy fat, but they store well and are easy to eat. Salmon and tuna are out for me due to mercury issues. Mackerel is good too but hard to find for me. 

Down side to sardines - maybe they don't taste amazing. 

So I messed around and here is how to make sardines delicious. 

Hot Sauce 

Mustard

Thats it! thats the secret. Mash up the sardines on a plate, pour liberal amount of mustard and some hot sause, mix thoroughly so it gets all up in there. Then I like to put that on a cracker or some blue corn chips. Honestly delicious. Takes all the fishy taste right out. I actually look forward to it. A nice green salad goes perfect with it, very healthy. 

So there you go. Try it.",2019-11-20 04:57:49

I assume this is due to to the cortisol spike causing a more scatter-brained state of mind and that makes quite a bit of sense.

Caffeine is... more interesting than I thought.,244,cbh8mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cbh8mm/caffeine_is_more_interesting_than_i_thought/,192,1562796915.0,"Long story short and correcting for all other lifestyle changes, experienced a very slow onset of depression like symptoms over the course of a year. Looking back, it started when my favorite diet soda halved its caffeine content, for some reason I drank them less. I then switched to water and also stopped drinking green tea at night because I hadn't had Gatorade in a long time and switched. Halved my morning coffee intake as well just to use less. I went from ~250mg caffeine daily to ~40mg. This wasn't a conscious attempt to quit, I just slowly replaced the drinks and could not pinpoint my lack of motivation, extreme boredom, and zero interest in anything which compounded to slowly lead me into a depressed state.


Turns out:

[Chronic caffeine alters the density of adenosine, adrenergic, cholinergic, GABA, and serotonin receptors and calcium channels in mouse brain](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00733753)

Caffeine blocks the release (or alters turnover) of serotonin, dopamine, and excites glutamate and norepinephrine. Leading you to less of the former and more of the latter. Pre-tolerance.

Yet also [increases serotonin by 26-30% and GABA by 65%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3437321/) post-tolerance, as the brain tries to overcompensate for the caffeine.

Edit: Dopamine may not be compensated for, but it is often given too much credit in terms of mood anyway.

It would appear acute withdrawal from caffeine (breaks between drinks with chronic use/tolerance) lends you to a desirable baseline in terms of mood. **Through overcompensation of the *negatives* of adenosine, you have dopamine and serotonin suppression causing them to sensitize, and through elevated levels of glutamate your mind counter balances by sensitizing GABA, and finally elevated norepinephrine once again overcompensates.**

*Acute withdrawals essentially act as an anti depressant and anxiolytic by making you more sensitive to baseline levels of the above?* This would make sense as for many caffeine puts them in an undesirable state in favor of waking themselves up. Hence the avoidance of caffeine by many once they feel awake.

Post acute withdraws after fully quitting would begin to become negative as your body reverses these sensitizations. 
___________

**TL;DR/ELI5** Caffeine blocks happy feelings and makes you jittery, over time your body compensates by making itself more sensitive to happy and calm feelings.

Once caffeine is out of your system (but you are still a chronic user), your normal levels of happy production return, but your brain is still more sensitive. End result is a better mood than normal. You do not gain a tolerance in the typical sense because this better mood *is* the tolerance. It is your body tolerating the bad brought on by caffeine (which is masked by the acute boost in norepinephrine).

 
If I am wrong about anything please let me know, but what is the general consensus on caffeine as a nootropic?

Edit: **Acute withdrawals** is time between dosing, NOT quitting. I am not proposing you get a mood boost from constantly getting addicted to and then quitting caffeine. Simply stating it appears that caffeine continues to boost your mood above baseline even when not being actively consumed.",2019-07-10 18:15:15

The problem is that it also makes me high, so I can't go about my life that way, and I only smoke once a week or so on average.

I would give anything to figure out why marijuana has this effect, so that I could attempt to imitate it with a substance that doesn't make me high. Anyone have thoughts?

CBD oil doesn't have this effect, nor do any of the dozens of supplements I've tried over the years, from bacopa to piracetam to curcumin.

## Introduction (feel free to skip) :

Some here may know me for my in-depth research regarding the topic of GABA based anxiolytics. I have researched regarding GABAergics that does not cause tolerance and down-regulation of GABAA receptors, and I have papers in this field on PubMed. My drive for learning this topic and sharing is due to some personal reasons.

## Common misconceptions regarding GABA A Receptor

Most GABAA positive allosteric modulators(PAM or PAMs), are actually agonists at the benzodiazepine site. Benzodiazepine site itself is a modulatory site of the GABAA receptor's chloride ion channel. Diazepam, for example, commonly known as valium, act as an agonist at the benzodiazepine site, which in return, ups the efficacy of chloride ion uptake. Ashwagandha, skullcap, and most herbal anxiolytics are believed to perform as a benzodiazepine partial agonist.


Direct agonist of GABAA receptors are rare, and they usually induce tolerance and dependence faster than benzodiazepines.
So does benzodiazepine agonist or partial agonists = GABAA PAM, yes you can understand it that way. However another misconception is that benzodiazepine antogonists such as flumazenil are stimulatory. No. An antagonist of a modulatory site means that the modulatory site loses its ability at modulating the modulated receptor.

Another misconception, **arent all benzodiazepines or GABAergics addictive? No,** It depends on the GABAA subunit binding profile of the specific benzodiazepine agonist interact with. Kava and many specific benzodiazepines have shown promise at being anxiolytics without impairing cognition / building tolerance.

Subunits:

- a1 Subunit. Recent research have shown that GABAA a1 to be the most addictive and tolerance building subunit. It leads the tolerance effect as a1 was found to be the subunit where agonists produce most of the downstream changes to your benzodiazepine receptors. a1 is also being the cognitive impairing, sedating, and memory worsening subunit. This means that drugs that avoid this receptor produces no sedating, memory impairing, tolerance, withdrawal, and abuse potential.

- a2 and a3 Subunits. a2 a3 selective agonists have shown to have significantly reduced abuse potential, with their main effects at reducing anxiety and promoting muscle relaxation. 

- a5 subunit is involved in memory, agonist has shown memory impairments while inverse agonists have shown memory enhancement.

This beautiful profile of GABAA a1, a2, a3, and a5 subunit brings a new era of pharmacology where anxiolytics with almost no abuse potential and tolerance is possible. A grand table of what effects GABAA a1, a2, a3, a5 subunits are responsible for in terms of their neuropharmacological profile, [please see table 1 in this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973310/pdf/ndt-14-1351.pdf)

*Just to be scientifically accurate, even subunits can be further categorized, such as: a1b2g2, a1b3g2 and a1b2g3, etc. However for the sake of this piece being understandable as well as lack of research in these further sub-categories, we will not talk about it more. Is it possible that 1 of these specific a1 subunits contribute more specific effects than another and therefore we can have 2 drug that are both a1 subunit agonist that produce different rate of sedation, tolerance building, etc.*


## Complete List (Pharmaceuticals):

- [Imidazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil), One of the most promising benzodiazepines in animal studies that have no human studies yet. It is a GABAA a2,a3 Partial agonist, weak to none a1,a4,a5 activities. Zero tolerance building in [monkeys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11224341) and [rat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8013567) studies when chronically high dosed. Pharmacologically speaking, effects should be moderately to strong, in terms of anxiolytic, anti-convulsant effects. Mild to no hypnotic and anti-epileptic effects, and also, mild to none amnesia effects.

- [MRK-409, aka MK-0343 in past literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147571), Another promising benzodiazepine. Partial agonist a2,a3, weak a1,a4,a5. Phase I halted due to unexpected sedating effects, it was not very sedating, just more than desired. Since it was designed as a sedation-free anxiolytic. Dosage in human studies was used between 0.1mg-3.0mg, optimum dose seems to around 1.0mg, 2.0mg starts to produce sedation. Tolerance should be none to very slow building.

- [L-838,417](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-838,417), Structurally related to MRK-409 and TPA-023, it has almost the same pharmacological profile as MRK-409 but have no human studies. It is a a2,a3,a5 partial agonist, even weaker on a1, and almost none on a4,a6. Effects should be same as MRK-409, maybe slightly more sedating due to partial agonism at a5. Tolerance building should be very slow if any.

- [Bretazenil, or Ro16-6028 in past literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretazenil), A promising, (Very low to low tolerance building)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8162672] benzodiazepine. Reached Phase III but halted due to sedation. Extremely promising, Extremely safe profile since it reached Phase III and was halted with sedation as only primary side effect - It was designed to be a sedation free anxiolytic. [Partial agonist a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7905829) [Doses as low as 0.25-0.5mg of bretazenil has shown to improve insomnia and reduce sleep disturbance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7746029)[Bretazenil Synergize with alcohol very well, better than diazepam, infact so well that one should actually not trying mixing them.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8799523) Effects of this drug should be Moderate in sedation, strong in anxiolytic, and moderate in anticonvulsive and epileptic effects. 
Ee
- [Abecarnil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abecarnil), handful of [promising human studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681563) - very slow tolerance building and only mild withdrawal was noted after chronic use (tolerance was only noted in high dosed groups). Extremely promising, large amounts of human data, [In humans, seems to cause little sedation, moderate to strong anxiolytic effects. Doses in studies ranged from 5mg to above 30mg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8097921). Looks promising.

- FG-8205 (AKA, L-663,581): almost exact profile as bretazenil, however less researched. 

- [TPA023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPA-023), Dont try this one, Phase I and II showed cataract building up in several participant, extremely promising profile, but unfortunate side effects means this drug has no human potential.

- [TPA023B, Structurally very similar to MRK-409 and L-838,417. a2,a3 partial agonism](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881109354928). Extremely similar profile and dosing as well as effects.

- [TPA123](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/contributions-of-gabaa-receptor-subtype-selectivity-to-abuse-liability-and-dependence-potential-of-pharmacological-treatments-for-anxiety-and-sleep-disorders/A2EEBCA675D1950F806C8F9DBEE3AA18), Tolerance building but slower than traditional benzodiazepines due to [partial agonism of a1,a2,a3,a5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19789360). Animal studies but lacking human studies. Should be a moderate sedative and strong anxiolytic. 

- [TPA003, Somewhere between agonist and partial agonist on a3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0346-0226-6_1), no action on a1 and very weak a5. Should be a strong anxiolytic and very weak hypnotic. I actually wrote a paper debating GABAA a3 to be strongly involved in anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, as most studies concluded that a2 was the ""sole"" contribution to anxiolytic effects. My understanding is that in a2 studies, mice ""seemed"" to be have less anxiety because they're seem calm, but they're only calm because a2 is also the strongest subunit target for myorelexation. TPA003 is definitely one of the most interesting compounds I have personally came across.

- [EVT-201](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVT-201),  has successful Trials, more ongoing. Low tolerance building, moderate to strong hypnotic, moderate to weak anxiolytic. Partial agonist at alpha1. Seems to be like a slightly better and less adictive version of current Z-Drugs. [See more on my past post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/6hy5jv/evt201_partial_agonist_of_benzodiazepine/)

- [PWZ-029](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6gg0eh/pwz029_mixed_agonistinverse_agonist_binding/), unique one, partial agonist a3, weak a1,a2, inverse agonist a5. PWZ-029 Improved memory and reduce anxiety at the same time in animal models. Human dosage unknown.

- [Ocinaplon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocinaplon), Care on this one, people with sensitive and liver problems should not try this as the entire Phase III was halted by a single participant whos liver enzyme spiked after this drug. [strongest action at a3, with interesting metabolites that are also similar in profile](https://bmcpharma.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2210-8-11). Otherwise seems extremely promising with good profile. Strong anxiolytic activites and weak hypnotic. [Human studies dosed 90mg 3 times a day, total 270mg/day, with good results, no side effects reported](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2009.00109.x/full)


- [PF-06372865](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Abstract/2018/09000/A_randomised,_placebo_controlled_clinical_trial.11.aspx). Another a2/a3 PAM. This one is being developed by Pfizer Inc. Pfizer's researchers have published promising animal studies with [ongoing trials](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bph.14119)
A study link:
https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bph.14119

- [AZD7325, Another a2/a3 PAM](https://openinnovation.astrazeneca.com/azd7325.html). Binding affinity is high at GABAAα1, α2 and α3 (Ki of 0.5, 0.3 and 1.3nM, respectively), but not GABAAα5 (230nM). AZD7325 is being studied in humans, its been administered orally to healthy volunteers at single doses of up to 100mg and repeated doses up to 50mg QD for 7 days. Adverse events were CNS in nature, and included dizziness, feeling of relaxation, euphoric mood, somnolence, and headache.  *""Two Ph2a General Anxiety Disorder studies have been conducted. In the first, AZD7325 was dosed at either 2 or 5mg BID or 10mg QD for 28 days achieving compound plasma exposures of ~4 x Ki. In the second, it was dosed at either 5 or 15mg BID for 28 days and compared with lorazepam. While the primary objective of greater efficacy vs. placebo and/or lorazepam, as assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety scale, were not met at any of the doses tested, the placebo response rate was considered to be high and reduction in other anxiety endpoints at 10mg and depression MADRS score were noted.""* 

- [Emapunil (aka AC-5216, or XBD-173)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5939/490), Emapunil is a ligands of the translocator protein [18 kilodaltons (kD)]. It may promote the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, which exerts fast-acting anxiolytic agent, both in animals and humans, which lacks the unwanted side effects of benzodiazepines. [Repeated administration shows lack of tolerance and dependence.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584609001699?via%3Dihub)

- [SB-205,384](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB-205,384). SB-205,384 seems to binds preferentially to α3, α5, and α6 subunit containing subtypes, animal models showed that it produces anxiolytic effects with minimal sedation.

- [RWJ-51204](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWJ-51204). Unclear GABAA binding profile, but sedative effects only come after 20x the dose required for anxiolytic effects.

## Complete List (Herbals):

- [Baicalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18723037). Baicalin is a herbal compound found in [Skullcap or Scutellaria-Baicalensis](https://examine.com/supplements/scutellaria-baicalensis/) and Scutellaria lateriflora. Baicalin showed significant preference for alpha2- and alpha3-containing subtypes compared to alpha1- and alpha5-containing subtypes in whole-cell patch clamp studies. Its effects should be mildly anxiolytic without sedating or memory-impairing effects.

- [Wogonin](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.07.011). Wogonin's GABAA profile is unclear, but mild sedative efffects were noted on top of anxiolytic and anti-convulsant effects.

- [K36](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.bcp.2003.08.016). K36 is interesting because it is the most potent plant-derived benzodiazepine agonist to date. It is reported to be an agonist at the a3 subunit, however, it also showed some effect at a1 although less potent. In animal models, results are promising as K36 showed anxiolytic effects without motor-impairment / sedative effects. Potentially hinting that its a1 efficacy is rather weak.

- [Valerenic Acid](https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390808001950). Not completely profiled, but shows a2 preferance over a3 and a5, and low to none efficacy at a1. Anxiolytic effects were noted in animal studies with no indication for sedation induced by valerenic acid.

- [Apigenin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15451406). Mild partial agonsit at a1, no complete profile. Low potency. Seems to be similar to green tea catechins in terms of effect.

- [Catechins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175819). Green tea catechins have extremely low bioavailability, and have shown to be a second-order PAM, which means it is a PAM of PAM, theoretically hinting that co-administration of green tea and xanax may enhance the effects of xanax.

- [Triethylene glycol, as found in Ashwaghanda](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172508). Unclear GABAA profile, is reported to be sedative, pass.

- [Withaferin-A from Ashwaghanda](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/view/96503). GABAA binding profile unclear. Shows anxiolytic efficacy without tolerance in rats following subchronic administration.

- Miltirone, https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0304-3940(91)90802-z, a partial agonsit of benzodiazepine receptors. No GABAA binding profile. Miltirone showed promising anxiolytic effects and was neither sedative nor addictive in mice even after chronic repeated administration. Miltirone also showed lower tolerance just as expected.

- [Kava's bioactive compounds](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157700), several kava compounds seem to have unique properties at the GABAA receptor. [Chronic heavy users of Kava appear to be perfectly fine in terms of dependence and cognitive function.](https://www.nature.com/articles/1300052) Caution, Kava contain amounts of liver toxins that vary by strain, this has caused unlucky users to suffer liver failure. 

- [Magnolol from Magnolia officinalis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3221106/) have shown to have efficacy to be an anti-convulsant in animal models just like diazepam, at 40 times the diazepam's dosage. GABAA binding profile unknown. [It is also an anxiolytic in animal models.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11186252)

"Creatine, 3.5g/daily for 15 days now, huge reduction in brain fog",242,9e5d8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9e5d8m/creatine_35gdaily_for_15_days_now_huge_reduction/,200,1536452168.0,"*__UPDATE 1/15/19: I had stopped taking creatine daily because I suspected it increased the number of night awakenings I was having, which compounded by my already questionable sleep quality, was worrisome. However I have resumed creatine in the form of 20 grams per day after very recently sustaining a very mild concussion. So far the creatine is helping with the headaches as well as the general fatigue in the week following the concussion. Studies have backed up its use in mild TBI so I will continue taking this dose until symptoms remit.__*

*__UPDATE 12/20/18: I have continued taking creatine for these past few months until very recently. I often eyeball the dosage with the scoop but it still remains between 2.5 and 5 grams of creatine. It’s effects on brain fog were still pronounced and definitely helped with returning to my baseline. I have STOPPED taking creatine the last few days to test it’s effects on my sleep. I recently resumed regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise to help me recover from my brain fog, and I was starting to suspect that the creatine combined with the effects of the exercise was giving me insomnia. However despite whatever results of this I still hold that creatine reduced my brain fog powerfully which benefitted me in my day to day life as well as at work.
I will note that it no longer gives me a sensation of anxiety or muscle tightness at any dose. And while it has reduced my brain fog, any effects on motivation are gone. It is definitely not a “pushy” feel.__*

*__UPDATE 09/24/18: About 30 days in. I am still dosing daily, and the effects have persisted. This is a dose of about 2.5 grams to sometimes 5 grams now. I have not seen any signs of brain fog creeping back. I am still subject to my quality of sleep, of course. Only CONS I notice are sometimes temporarily heightened anxiety after a dose, and at 5 grams I notice a tension in my neck and shoulders that lasts about an hour. I am still taking creatine monohydrate, though a bulk powder version of it. I am still making sure to hydrate appropriately. I also have continued to take it in the morning, before food. The only other thing I am taking is a lutein and zeaxanthin supplement I started 3 days ago.__*    


For a few years now I’ve had a persistent case of brain fog. It gets worse when I sleep fully, I.e 8 hours. If I’m feeling sleep deprived, the fog itself is somewhat abated but I have all the cognitive deficiencies that come with less sleep.    


My brain fog is a muddling of poor short term memory, slow reaction time, a very powerful unwillingness to engage in any kit of cognitively demanding task, and just the urge to do nothing and go back to sleep.    

Caffeine, nicotine, semax, phenylpiracetam, piracetam, theanine, prl-8-53, testosterone replacement therapy, exercise, magnesium, probiotics, sleeping with no light/sound, and a bunch of other things have not helped it at all.    

I started taking creatine on a whim after hearing it might help with maintaining proper cognition after sleep deprivation. Unexpectedly, I have felt a very significant reduction in my brain fog. I can feel it cutting through the fog, I am able to think more holistically instead of barely being able to focus on one small thing at a time. My memory has returned. And so has my motivation.    

This is a dose of 3.5 grams daily for the last 15 days. I have seen no build up of tolerance.    

I am submitting this to provide another data point as well as to see if anyone has had any similar experiences. I will update if I stop taking creatine or if the effects change.    

EDIT1: The brand is a GNC brand. Monohydrate. Nothing special.

Using Propranolol and gradually reducing the dosage to zero actually somewhat permanently reduced my anxiety,238,cfxz26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cfxz26/using_propranolol_and_gradually_reducing_the/,98,1563736701.0,"Basically, in my work, I'm required to interact with many people in important events. I would get anxiety during these (fast heart rate, face going red, voice breaking, etc).

The doctor prescribed me propranolol to help with the anxiety. I took it for my first big presentation and felt very good, the crowd responded well and I felt pretty good about myself. This first experience of doing this presentation slightly increased my overall confidence, knowing that I was able to actually give a good presentation.

Each successive presentation I **slightly** lowered the dosage of propranolol, and I was still able to give a good presentation! This just made me more confident about myself which I guess had a snowball effect. After about 6 months of many presentations and incrementally lowering the dose for each big event, I realised, that each successive presentation would slightly boost my confidence, which then offset the small decreases in my propranolol doses. Every good presentation I did improved my reputation and the way my colleagues saw me, which subsequently increased my overall self-esteem, and over time, my dosage got small enough and eventually reached zero. 

&#x200B;

So basically in my experience, controlled doses of propranolol can work to reduce long-term anxiety/increase confidence. The way I see it, controlled doses of propranolol is analogous to nudging a snowball down a hill- once you nudge it bit by bit, eventually the ball can continue rolling itself without needing any more nudges.

Insight on caffeine and how it works.,237,af689k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/af689k/insight_on_caffeine_and_how_it_works/,77,1547317798.0,"I stumbled on something at [examine.com](https://examine.com) which is a small thing, but I found it quite interesting. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors (adenosine builds up when we are awake and makes us tired in the evening), which I'm sure many are aware of, but what I found interesting was the distinction between A1- and A2A-receptors and the fact that it is only A2A receptors that get desensitized (which explain quite a lot).

>*Caffeine can block different adenosine receptors in the brain, with varying effects. By blocking the A1 receptor, which promotes sleepiness when activated, caffeine can increase alertness.\[44\]\[45\] By blocking the A2A receptor, caffeine can increase dopamine levels, with stimulating and mood-enhancing effects.\[46\]*  
>  
>*The A1 receptor doesn’t seem to get desensitized, which may be why caffeine doesn’t lose its awakening effect. The A2A receptor does get desensitized, however, which is why coffee veterans don’t feel true stimulation even after drinking several cups — and why some people choose to cycle caffeine.*

L-Theanine and Ashwagandha have helped my severe depression any anxiety.,236,cmwwxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cmwwxp/ltheanine_and_ashwagandha_have_helped_my_severe/,94,1565157997.0,"I know there have been many posts about this, but I wanted to share my experience here. If it violated any of the rules please let me know.

I've had depression and OCD since I was a young kid. In my childhood I went through trauma which caused all those conditions. And I didn't know until I was diagnosed recently.

*Disclaimer*: I've been working on myself heavily, but I'm pretty sure that the following supplements have helped me.

I didn't want to take medication so I started experimenting with different things that my doc suggested along with what I've seen here. I started out with St. John's Wort, which didn't do much. My understanding is that it's for mild depression and I've had severe clinical depression over the past 3-4 years. Also it did nada for anxiety, let alone OCD.

To supplement SJW, I started taking 200mg of 5-HTP daily, which I now want to start cutting back on. I've noticed that it's helped, but I can't quantify it. I did notice myself getting worse when I ran out for a few days though.

I've also been taking 200mg of L-Theanine and Ashwaganha twice a day. Both have helped substantially to lower my anxiety levels and reaction (rumination and compulsions) to intrusive thoughts. It still happens, but much less.

There are mornings that I woke up with a looming feeling of stress for no apparent reason. Usually this meant that the day ahead would be a tough one, but after I started taking L-Theanine and forcing myself to move and do things to distract myself the anxiety goes down significantly and I'm able to carry on with my day to day functions.

A common casualty of clinical depression and OCD is your sex drive and the ability to get and maintain an erection. Well, I can attest to that. For years I didn't even get my morning wood, despite me being healthy, according to my doctor. A week after I started taking Ashwagandha I noticed that I started getting morning wood again and on occasion it would be very strong and wouldn't lose it even while peeing. Most of the times I lose it moments after I wake up, but it's better than nothing.

I still have difficulty getting a normal erection, but I've noticed an improvement. Before I wouldn't be able to get hard even with fantasies and now that has started changing. I've also noticed myself getting very occasionally (once or twice a month) a random boner. By ""random"" I mean that I may see a girl dressed provocatively or flirt with a girl I like and I'll get a hard on. But even in these cases, the erections are probably a 20%.

Small steps.

However, I assure you that they have all been answered before. The search function works well, please use it before asking basic questions that we have all seen 100 times. I do not want to discourage discussions. However, we should limit those discussions to trying to expand information, not regurgitate what we already know.

* Modafinil is a wakefulness promoting agent.

* Modafinil will not replace dopaminiergic stimulants for ADHD.

* Modafinil will not work for everyone.

* Both enantiomers in racemic modafinil are active.

* R-modafinil is 3 times more active.

* Generics seem to be hit or miss. Some think they are the exact same, other don't...

* Your order will take a while to get here. Don't ask us if this is a normal thing.

* Modafinil increases hypothalamic histamine. This can lead to flush-like symptoms.

* There is a 99.999999% chance that you do not have Steven Johnson's Syndrome. If you did, Reddit is not the place to figure that out.

* No, the DEA will not throw you in jail for ordering modafinil. There is a chance that DHS will confiscate your order. If you are in Canada, then there is a higher risk of it being confiscated.

* It is not a miracle drug for improving cognition. There is no such thing. I'm sorry Limitless has misled you.

So if you find any new information on modafinil that is interesting, by all means post it here so we can discuss it. Please, no more long winded anecdotes about how modafinil worked for you.

I don't drink coffee so I reliably track my caffeine consumption to stay in the sub-300 mg per day range.

I don't really get negative effects from it (no jitters, no anxiety, no serious tolerance) but I do crash hard quite often.  This appears to the result of some kind of pharmacokinetic drawback.  

For some reason, re-dosing never fully fixes the problem.  Once the ""crash"" kicks in, it's basically permanent until the next day.  (Side comment - does anyone have any explanation for this?)

Over the past month I've been taking 100 mg of extended-release caffeine 2-3x per day, and it has been a completely different experience.  There is no crash at all, and while its presence is a tiny bit more subtle, I get a much more useful set of effects out of it.

Non-caffeine days are also a bit easier, as I suppose my brain no longer anticipates a rush of energy every morning.  If I don't take caffeine, I'm still pretty lethargic in comparison.  But it's definitely not as bad as it used to be.

Out of the hundreds of nootropics I've tried, XR caffeine is easily in first place by a mile.  

I highly recommend switching to non-caffeinated drinks and strictly using XR caffeine if you are looking for a solution to crashes, jitters, anxiety, etc.",2019-11-20 20:20:42

The results have been nothing short of extraordinary.

*“Man conquers the world by conquering himself.” - Zeno*

&#x200B;

At 13 years of age, I was involved in a car accident which resulted in a severe TBI. This, along with playing 6 years of American football (multiple minor concussions, etc.) all throughout high school/college has left me with severe anxiety (social and general), insomnia and reoccurring depression in young adulthood. 

I do see a doctor regularly, however, the medications I am prescribed provide a band-aid cure at best, but no long term solutions. 

Regular exercise and my adoption of a ketogenic/IF diet have done wonders for my anxiety, but I would still struggle at times, especially with insomnia.

After an extremely rough patch a couple of months ago, I did some research and decided to start the following protocol (beginning July 30th) twice-weekly, approximately 6 hours before bedtime:

* 10-20mg Yohimbine HCL
* 15-30 minutes Ice Bath
* Wim-Hof style breathing (40 breaths in/out, last exhale hold 15s+, inhale hold 15s+)

If you can handle the initial feelings/emotions of extreme discomfort/terror/impending doom/freezing to death/trepidation, the benefits are innumerable.

This is hormesis at its finest.

This protocol has improved my mindstate moreso than any herb, nootropic, practice or supplement I have ever used. At work, I am a productive machine. My social life is the best it has ever been and I consistently find myself pushing outside of my comfort zone to engage with new people. My sleep is now deep, regular and uninterrupted. Things that used to give me debilitating anxiety now seem like a joke (namely social situations/work deadlines). My time in the gym is now enjoyable; workouts I used to find challenging (psychologically and physically) are now commonplace. 

This semi-weekly torture sesh seems to force me into a state of mindfulness that extends to all areas of my life. 

The overall attitude/outlook on life that this practice seems to provide me is ""nothing that might occur in my everyday life could possibly be any worse than what I just experienced.""

Looking for some intelligent discussion on the matter. Will be happy to provide more sources if need be! I realize this is extreme (masochistic even) and should only be considered after other potential options have been thoroughly explored.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Over the last couple of years, I have had the opportunity to try many nootropics/supplements to help rid myself of anxiety/depression and improve my everyday functioning. Some of them I found to be extremely helpful, others seemed to have no effect, or were very effective but unsustainable. A semi-weekly session of 15-30 minute ice baths along with an anxiogenic dose of Yohimbine HCL and some Wim Hof breathing is a solution that suits me quite well. YMMV.

LSD in my Coffee - My 2 Month Miccrodosing Review,234,7dlp2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7dlp2t/lsd_in_my_coffee_my_2_month_miccrodosing_review/,89,1510961417.0,"Hey friends! Like so many of you here, I was intrigued by the many possible benefits of microdosing LSD. Having taken normal (100-200 mcg) doses in the past and fortuitously having access to some quality LSD, I decided to give it a shot. I kept a journal throughout these two months, with entries for the majority of the days I dosed.

**edit** - No, I was not putting tabs of LSD in my coffee, I was using them sublingually 

*Background* - 28 year old male, pretty extensive experience with nootropics of all sorts, neurotrophics, adaptogens, etc. I'd used mushrooms and LSD on and off for a period of two or three years, from about 19-22, and have only used full doses once or twice since then. Plenty of years of meditation under my belt, as well as regular exercise, yoga, very healthy diet with plenty of greens, yada yada. I say all this just to explain that I have experience with mind-altering substances, am well aware of the placebo effect and that I am fairly fine-tuned with understanding how a multitude of factors may be affecting my subjective experience of the world. 

**Dosing protocol** - My plan was to pretty much stick to the dosing protocol outlined by **James Fadiman**, namely of taking 8-12 mcgs once every 3 days. Sometimes it was one dose every 4 or 5 days, and once I dosed twice within three days, but I otherwise stuck to his protocol. That said, I did *not* dose volumetrically, and would like to do so in the future - because of this, each dose I took was not exact, and I know a few of the doses were closer to 20 or 25 micrograms, just because of how I was cutting the tabs. This was fine by me, as I wanted to see what kind of results these higher doses would bring.

I'll start with the cons.


**Cons**

*Decrease in raw computing power and focus* - Contrary to what many others find, I found that my raw mental power and focus actually *dropped slightly*, by around maybe 5-10 percent, more if the dose was higher. I'd say that my baseline in these two areas is pretty good, nothing phenomenal, but I have no problem sitting down to read or write for anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours before needing a break, and am able to handle a very busy shift at work bartending with little to no errors. My thoughts are almost never erratic, and definitely don't suffer from any ADHD. 

The slight drop in focus and computing power was certainly not off-putting in any way, and in fact I found it mostly beneficial. It felt like I could make associations more quickly, and was more able to think *laterally* rather *linearly*. I would say microdosing increased my creativity and associative thinking. I was able to concentrate if needed, but if I needed absolute attention and raw computing power, I'd rather not have microdosed that day. I work as a bartender and the weekends certainly get intense. I'd always make sure that I wouldn't microdose on days that I knew I'd have a hectic shift.

*Decrease in working memory* - As alluded to above, if I needed to remember 4 different cocktails for one table, ring up a to go order, fire an entree for seat 12 because their appetizer just landed and then try to describe the subtle differences between our flagship IPA and our new lupulin powder based IPA, a microdose would likely throw me off a bit. I found that microdosing decreased my performance and memory in intense situations by maybe 5-10% - I just wouldn't be firing on all pistons. 

*No desire to lift* - Self-explanatory. I'd have to force myself to go lift in the gym, whereas normally I have to force myself to take days off every now and then. Trail running, on the other hand... 

*Higher doses* - Higher doses increased the effects of all the cons listed above. At higher doses (ballpark 20 mcgs), I fumbled my words sometimes, had difficulty remembering something specific, and really didn't have any interest in doing anything productive. That said, things were still quite enjoyable, and I delighted in going for a run in the mountains, a walk in the park, playing with my dog, socializing, listening to music... But I didn't want to be productive or work.


**Neutral**

*Decrease in sex drive* - No surprise here for me, LSD has always made me disinterested in sex. No ED or anything, just could take it or leave it.

*Gas in my teeth* - Not sure why, but the body load of acid or mushrooms has always made me feel like there was some sort of chemical gas in my teeth especially, and sometimes bones and muscles. It's weird, not necessarily bad, and with microdosing was present to a much lesser degree, maybe 50% of the time.

*Little in terms of 2nd day afterglow* - Many people have reported that you microdose one day, have an afterglow or even enhanced effects on the 2nd day, and return to baseline to reset homeostasis on the third. Maybe half of the time I noticed an afterglow on the second day, namely a slightly better mood above baseline, but not really anything ""cognitive enhancement"" wise. May have just been placebo effect since I heard Dr. Fadiman explain it. Not sure, and thats ok.


**Pros**

*Enhanced creativity* - While dosing may have slightly hampered raw computing mental power, it *definitely* increased creativity and associative thinking. Many an insight was made while microdosing, and I was able to see connections between seemingly unrelated things. In this sense, microdosing would fit the bill of a cognitive enhancer, and I could see it having its place in my tool cabinet for all the reading, writing and research I do.

*More synchronicity* - Many of you who have used psychedelics at full doses have probably had more than a few instances of intense synchronicities, coincidences, deja vu, and intuitiveness. Psychedelics are often considered spiritual in nature so this should be of no surprise. While dosing, there were plenty of times when I would think of something I hadn't thought of in a while, be it a topic, object or person, only to have them pop up that same day or the following. Whether you call that intuitiveness or something else, it was noticeable maybe 70% of the times I dosed.

*Enhanced enjoyment* - Man, I just *really* enjoyed my days microdosing. It was all the little things one would expect - music didn't sound different, but it was more enjoyable; driving all these local backroads in the fall, while looking the same as if I wasn't microdosing, was much more enjoyable; I appreciated all the little things more. I wasn't high or felt any kind of pleasant buzz, but I appreciated things a lot more.

*Positive selfishness* - There's probably a term for this, but on days I dosed, I was much more likely to just do what I *wanted* to do, whether or not it was what I *should* be doing. I also found it very easy to say no to things I didn't want to do or to things that others might try to force on me, and all of this in a guilt-free way. And I don't mean I just said yes to eating pizza and drinking beer - more than once while microdosing I drove around the local backroads finishing podcasts I found interesting, or I knew I should be going to the gym, but decided to take my dog for a walk in the park because that was the more enjoyable and meaningful thing to do. If some friends asked me to meet up for a few drinks, I was perfectly happy to say no and continue reading or go through with hiking like I had planned.

*Enjoyment of social interactions* - I'm a pretty social person anyway, and really enjoy interacting with people, be they friends, customers at work or random people on the street or at a bar. This enjoyment was *greatly* enhanced on days I dosed. I found myself interacting more often with random people I didn't know, with no hesitation. I was more likely to make jokes and play around with customers rather than just trying to offer good service. **This was maybe my favorite aspect of dosing**, as well as the following effect.

*More playful* - I'm already a pretty playful person, cracking jokes, playing little pranks, role playing with friends and coworkers. On days I dosed, this was enhanced greatly, and this was the aspect I enjoyed the most. I love people, and the combination of enjoying social interactions and being even more playful *alone* would be enough reason to keep microdosing a regular thing in my life.




**TL;DR** In short, microdosing, for me, *scatters* my mental energies ever so slightly. It slightly decreases my ability to focus in on something, but is great for enhancing sociability, creativity, enjoyment of the majority of activities, especially interacting with others, and is definitely something I would like to continue to experiment with in the future. I'd love to try it with psilocybin mushrooms or psilocybin itself, but alas, these are currently unavailable to me. ",2017-11-17 18:30:17

Reviewing EVERY nootropic I've bought (33 substances),228,frczn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/frczn4/reviewing_every_nootropic_ive_bought_33_substances/,300,1585543617.0,"Edit: post calling me out is complete misinformation. I described EVERYTHING I felt with these nootropics. I used them all as advised, but doubled dose at the end if I felt nothing. Sorry if this review isn't everything you expected it to be.

&#x200B;

This is a lot, but I'm bored, so here we go. They will be ranked from least-most beneficial. This is all subjective. What was I attempting to cure? Anxiety, depression, withdrawals, and lack of motivation.

**Nootropics that were a complete waste of money (don't get offended):**

*Inositol* \- I took 1 gram, all the way up to 17 grams. Nothing. No reduction in anxiety or depression. Also incredibly expensive and bulky.

*Jujube* \- I'm not sure if this is really a nootropic, but since it is a supposed anxiolytic, maybe? I started a low dose and then worked my way up to a high dose of about 30 grams or something of dry powder. All that happened was I got a little tired, no cognitive benefits.

*Mucuna Pruriens* \- This one is a little debatable, but I fail to see what the hype is about. I took the recommended doses, and once doubled it, but saw very little results, if any.

*5-HTP* \- I guess this one will make a lot of people mad, but from my standpoint, this was useless. I didn't really feel any different after using it, maybe just a little more tired? Perhaps serotonin isn't my problem.

*GABA* \- This is an interesting one, because at first use I felt some-what relaxed for about an hour. Usage after that lacked any benefit, though I kept taking it for the growth hormone benefit. But the depressed breathing side effect was VERY anxiogenic, and all in all is not worth it at all.

*Ashwagandha* \- KSM-66 and regular ashwagandha for about a month inflamed my thyroid. Felt like I was being choked. The side effect stopped after I discontinued use. I read up afterwards and learned ashwagandha tampered with thyroid hormones. Also, did not feel any benefits at all while using this one.

*Sulbutiamine* \- I bought this stuff seeking a little stimulation, perhaps a mood lift. Nothing. All that happened was disappointment, so I decided to take 5 of them, totalling 1 gram on an empty stomach. It resulted in me puking violently, with traces of blood in my puke. Threw away the bottle after that.

*St John's Wort* \- Figured I would give this one a try. Didn't see any results with regular doses, so I took double the amount, and still nothing. Decided not to re-purchase when it ran out.

*L-Theanine* \- Here's another one that might piss people off. I saw no result at all from using this stuff. I suppose it's a little nice to take it with coffee, might take some of the edge off, but aside from that I'm not sure if there's any functionality, or if it is worth the cost. Would not recommend unless drinking matcha tea.

*Schisandra Chinensis* \- This is an adaptogen, so it's possible that I didn't take it long enough, but I spent 10 dollars on it, for a high-content extract, and after two weeks I was already running out. Didn't notice any improvement to mood or motivation, even with a high dose.

*Maca* \- At the time of me getting this, I was a daily kratom user, so my libido was really messed up. After taking it consistently for months, I can't say I really saw an improvement on anything, energy or anything.

*Kanna* \- I've tried this sublingual, and smoked. No clear benefits. J'm not sure if it did anything, really.

**Nootropics that were** ***kind of*** **worth it, but not enough to justify price:**

*Lithium Orotate* \- This stuff is iffy for me. I've taken it alone and alongside agmatine sulfate (foreshadowing here). I think it *may have* potentiated agmatine sulfate, but now I'm not so sure. I've stopped using it and seen no real difference.

*Polygala Tenuifolia* \- I'm still playing around with this stuff I guess. The first time I took a high dose and fell asleep on the couch. After that I lowered it with some variety. Not feeling much improvement, and I'm not sure if it really does anything for me. I thought it was supposed to be stimulating. Maybe it synergizes with agmatine? Not sure.

*Cordyceps* \- The first time I took this stuff, I was wired out of my mind. Now I don't feel any change at all. I'm skeptical if it is doing anything. May work for some, but not sure if it works for me.

*Noopept* \- This stuff isn't bad, but on it's own, I don't see what the point is. When I combined it with American Skullcap (smoked) or phenylpiracetam, I felt like I had razor sharp focus. But aside from that, there's not much in the way of motivation or anxiolyticism for me.

*Rhodiola Rosea* \- I've only been taking this for a few days, so take this with a grain of salt. But I'm not seeing the point of this stuff. I've taken twice the recommended dosage, and nothing. No results. I guess time will tell, but so far, I'm not seeing the point.

*Hydrafinil* \- I suppose it kind-of works. I suppose it is some-what stimulating. Subtly. But is it stimulating enough to justify price? No. It also makes me hostile when I'm on it. I don't like putting this foreign substance into my body either, so considering how it's not NEARLY as effective as caffeine, I don't think it's worth it.

*L-Glycine* \- I've heard this talked about as a nootropic. I'm not sure how it qualifies as one, maybe because of the serotonergic functionality, maybe for sleep, it's unclear. I started taking it for sleep, obsessive thinking and for growth hormones. It didn't do much for sleep or for obsessive thinking, so I don't think it's really worth it. (review from taking 20 grams)

**Nootropics that were** ***alright:***

*Magnolia Bark Extract* \- Definitely some benzo-esque vibes here. Kind of euphoric. Potentiated a ton when taken with American Skullcap. But I can't say it helped me a whole lot mentally, or enough to justify the price and possible addiction.

*Kava* \- This stuff worked. Yes, it is a relaxing nootropic. But it did nothing for my social anxiety, and it depressed me while I was on it. There's hepatoxicity associated with it, it's super expensive, and all in all, I don't think it's worth it. I'd much rather have a beer, as bad as that sounds.

*Creatine* \- Just putting this here because for whatever reason it is considered a nootropic. No bad experiences with it. Worth the money for bodybuilding. I guess it's considered a stimulant some-how, but I wouldn't take it for cognitive effects.

*Uridine Monophosphate, Fish Oil, Alpha GPC* \- Putting these down here because I do believe they may have contributed to alleiviating some of my depression symptoms. They didn't help with motivation, they contributed to a manic episode at one point, and there are physical benefits associated with fish oil and alpha gpc (growth hormones on this one). They might have helped repair my dopamine receptors a bit, though it's too early to tell. This combo can be slightly euphoric in high doses.

*Multivitamin* \- I'm just putting this here because it's some-how considered a nootropic. It didn't change me at all, but it's good to have because the western diet has poor nutrition, which could be bad for cognitive abilities.

**Nootropics that benefitted me, but had short-comings:**

*Yohimbe* \- Excellent pre-workout. Insane stimulant. Doesn't do much for mental benefits, but supposedly can lead to fear extinction through continued use because of its adrenaline spiking. Helps me move faster at work and in the gym. Worth every cent. Only bad experience is over-stimulation sometimes and slight mental shocks.

*Phenylpiracetam* \- Best thing I've found for motivation, social anxiety, and focus. BUT it doesn't even work if you take it the next day. Or the next day. Or a few days later. I used to think three days was the key but even that wasn't true. It's like a once-a-week, once-every-two-weeks stimulant. No addiction, withdrawal, side effects. The tolerance issue really sucks, and dosing higher doesn't seem to fix it.

*American Skullcap* \- When I first tried this stuff, I left a raving review and it blew up. I'm coming back here to say, yes there are a lot of benefits to using it, but not general overall benefits. It works good for helping you quit other drugs, as you can smoke it and put your feeling of wanting to get high into the skullcap, because it's non-addictive and helps with withdrawal symptoms. It also seems to help with focus, especially in combination with phenylpiracetam or noopept. It's relaxing, but I wouldn't say good for sleep. Once I was having a minor anxiety attack, and it helped me chill out a bit. Doesn't do anything for social anxiety, it's not euphoric, and I really don't need to use it that much at all. May be good for some people, though.

**Nootropics that changed my life (so far):**

***Agmatine Sulfate*** \- After I started using this stuff, my depressive lows were healed. I stopped dwelling on negative thoughts, I felt better about myself, and this led to an upward spiral in my life, where a lot of my hardcore depression symptoms were alleiviated completely. I felt some-what cognitively-enhanced, like I was thinking clearer, and the experience has been great, two months later. It did not help with fatigue or lack of motivation, but overall, I highly recommend this one.

***NAC*** \- When I first began taking this stuff, I was using it as a liver support because I was taking some questionable things, and I didn't want liver damage. But what was crazy, is I just so happened to pull it together and quit kratom. I also was picking my face less. At the time, I didn't expect any of these benefits from it. This leads me to believe that NAC is excellent at fighting addiction. That being said, I still felt the needy impulse to text girls, and I still picked at my face, so I guess it's not perfect. Overall, though, I highly recommend this, especially to addicts. It may just change your mind-set.

***Caffeine (Coffee)*** \- I've been taking caffeine and coffee my whole life, as I'm sure many of you have. There's downsides to it, as I'm sure many of you know, but the benefits outweigh the negatives. It helps my social anxiety, though worsening my physical anxiety symptoms, and helps with motivation. It also puts me in a better mood, especially coffee with its MAOIs. I don't mind being addicted to this substance, though I don't like that it can make me more impulsive through adrenaline and dopamine. Out of everything I've tried, caffeine remains one of the best nootropics available. And I plan to see how I can further build my stack around this substance, because as far as I know, there's not much that can come close to beating it.",2020-03-30 00:46:57

Also I had a bad MRI (there were myelin lesions in the left frontal lobe). Doctors couldn't explain the reason. Medicine is terrible in Russia. Have sent to the psychiatrist who has begun paxil - from it or him only became worse in a month. Because the problem was more serious.

For testing, I prepared two boxes, in which I put nootropics. Most of the nootropics I tested before getting to know this subreddit - I got from doctors on prescription (I visited many different doctors) 

1) Nootropics that helped

2) Nootropics that do not fit (no effect or too strong side effects)


Before sending the substance to the box number 2, I tested it several times

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 box (Nootropics that helped):

Bromantane (my top https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6imfwc/bromantane_is_the_best_drug/)

Phenibut (instant socialization, anxiety reduce, better motivation, energy, vision and focus, powerfull antidepressive effect. I would take it forever, but it has a very fast tolerance. You can take 2 times a week. Otherwise there will be a strong withdrawal and drowsiness)

Uridine (very nice https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6fkq42/finally_i_got_to_uridine/)

Piracetam (basic nootropic for memory, mood, energy, vision. The effect isn't very strong, but you can take it forever. Other substances strengthen piracetam)

Alcar (energy, better vision, strengthens piracetam)

ALA (for alcar)

Meldonium (for energy)

sunflower lecithine (safe choline source, for piracetam)

Omega3 (small effect against depression)

Vitamine d (small effect against drowsiness)

Vitamine b6/b12 

Potassium (for alcar)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 box (Nootropics that do not fit (no effect or too strong side effects)):

Methylcolabomin/Methylfolate (super drowsiness and weakness. It sounds like nocebo, but I tried it several times. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6nh2p9/b12folate_deficiency_symptoms/dka8icb/)

Semax (brainfog and problem with concentration. At first he even helped me, but after the addition of piracetam, horror began. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/661x9q/semax_piracetam_brainfog/)

Microdosing (hard to think https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/69l6la/first_day_mictodosing/)

Noopept (robot with bad short-term memory https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6o2hvi/noopept_amazing_productivity/dke2e87/)

Caffeine/L-theanine (drowsiness. After a few days, it causes drowsiness. Probably because of l-theine. I read similar stories)

Nicotine (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6nzu6m/i_cant_use_nicotine_why/)

Intranasal insulin (brainfog, drowsiness, dizzy. I tried from 10iu to 40iu)

L-tyrosine, Nalt (good result in first day, drowsiness in others. Like all the nootropics from this list - I've tried it several times. Each time such an effect)

Ginkgo (stomach pain)

Coluracetam (super depression with suicidal thoughts. A terrible thing. I don't know why, but tried several times sublingually)

Oxyracetam, alpha-gpc (depression. Alpha-gpc in many causes cholina depression, I'm no exception. Oxiratsetam acts on me like a coluracetam, but weaker.)

Emoxypine (mexifican/mexidol) (drowsiness, for 3 weeks except drowsiness nothing happened)

Aniracetam (choking. I took a few steps and started a shortage of air. After that, I checked my heart. It's all right. None of nootropics anymore caused this problem. Even the perception of the world has changed. It's hard to describe)

Huperzine (strong dizziness. It was scary)

Rhodiola (dizziness, very strange condition. The effect is unpleasant)

Picamilon (a little stimulation and relaxation for a couple of hours. Fast tolerance)

Actovegin (tried in tablets. Very expensive drug and weak effect. The positive effect is definitely there, but it is not worth the money)

Phenylpiracetam (it always causes me a very strong migraine. Choline doesn't help. No other substance causes such headaches.)

This bill will literally create a  blanket ban access for the government and AG jeff sessions to ban all  compounds instantly, instead of the DEA having to individually take a  specific substance and prove with an 8 factor analysis that it is a  threat to the american people. Very similar to what happened in the UK a  few years back with the psychoactive substance act. The SITSA bill  would not only ban all research chems but Nootropics as well such as  kratom phenibut modafinil and tianeptine among many others. According to  an email I received a few days ago by the American Kratom Association,  the FDA lobbied a powerful figure within this meeting to ensure it  passes onto the House Floor. If it goes through there then it is all in  Jeff Sessions hands at that point. 

I just learned about this yesterday  from the kratom subreddit where an individual stated this information  from the House Rules Committee meeting where they addressed the SITSA   bill,  ""For those who were watching the House Rules Committee Hearing  this   afternoon, it was expected that Representative Pocan would  present his   kratom amendment before the Committee.  Unfortunately, the  combination   of the delay in the start of the Rules Committee Hearing,  and another   legislative issue that required the presence of  Representative Pocan in   another Hearing and a House Floor issue that  prevented him from getting   back to the Rules Committee before the  SITSA portion of the  Hearing  was closed.  Representative Pocan did  file the kratom amendment  in a  timely way, and the Rules Committee  should vote on the amendment  before  SITSA is referred to the Floor.   If the Rules Committee defeats  the  kratom amendment, we will then look  to amend SITSA on the House  Floor.   The House is expected to vote on  SITSA on Friday""

Top 5 Nootropics that have helped me the most.,231,8fajc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8fajc2/top_5_nootropics_that_have_helped_me_the_most/,148,1524852714.0,"There are top 5 nootropics that have helped me the most.

**BRIEF HISTORY**

* 22 year old college student. High-stress environment, but I never *feel* stress acutely like most people, though I do feel it chronically as ""burnout"" (threshold: 10h+ days for 4 weeks+ with no breaks in-between).
* ONE Thing that makes it or breaks it: **Sleep from 8-10pm, Wake at 4:30am**
* What ALWAYS helps: Meditate, Exercise, and Diet regularly (one cheat day a week). *[next step: add cardiovascular work with C25K]*
* Extremely sensitive to changes in these routines (especially sleep schedule). Without them, would occasionally have moodswings with depressed mood (but nothing clinically diagnosed). It gets VERY BAD, but as long as most of the aforementioned things are in place they NEVER happen. I'm confident that as long as my sleep is REGULAR, the whole world could be in flames and somehow I still wouldn't be able to feel depressed.
* Default personality: Type A and always building up momentum, getting things done and moving things forward. These things make me feel alive. Conversely, when things are moving purposelessly slow, I become bored (immediate), restless/anxious (short-term) and depressed (long-term).
* Highly-sensitive to external stimulus. Noise isolation headphones and earplugs work really well for me because they essentially conserve all the energy that would've otherwise been dissipated to these trivial stimuli.
* No history of insomnia. No history of psychiatric or medical conditions (previously had pre-hypertension).

Nootropic | Effect on me
---|---
Fish Oil | Classic staple for cardiovascular health. 
CoQ10 | Classic staple for cardiovascular and hypertension
Bacopa | Improved memory in the first year. Can tell loss of effect if I'm off for 1month+
L-Tyrosine | Gamechanger for me. Able to focus on only ONE thing at a time. This plus earplugs gets me in the zone without fail (most effective fasted)
Ashwagandha | Always works to relieve stress. My mind feels lighter. **Too much and I feel like I'm just drifting through life though**. But if coupled with L-Tyrosine can be very effective. (Not effective with Rhodiola, Caffeine/L-Theanine, must be used in isolation and does not improve my sleep).

Other nootropics that I take as needed:

Nootropic | Effect on me
---|---
Rhodiola | No significant effect. Taking it regularly now to finish the bottle. Seems to keep moodswings at bay. (Thinking of removing it, what do you guys think?)
Phenibut | Think of it as a stronger Ashwaganda, or as a supplement with only the positive effects of Alcohol.
Caffeine/L-Theanine | AVOIDING IT. With all the nootropics available to get me into a calm focused state and generate high-quality work, it makes no sense to me to go back to caffeine. One cup would get me energized, but that energy is dissipated and not channeled. Two cups would again get me in the zone when I am ready to kill a fucking lion. Three cups and I won't be able to sleep. It's great for anything physical (pre-workout for a gym PR), but terrible for any intellectual where higher cognitive functions are required (learning). **Coffee is like a shotgun whereas L-Tyrosine is like a sniper rifle.** Replaced with green tea instead.
Magnesium | No noticeable effect. Seems to keep moodswings at bay. Still taking it because there's no harm. (Thinking of removing it, what do you guys think?)

What are the top 5 nootropics you swear by? What nootropics should I remove from my stack?

"Hey /r/nootropics, I need your help/input with an experiment I am running, it's like a coffee brew that mimics the effects of an LSD microdose (in me at least, and I'm curious about others)",231,2xonnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2xonnt/hey_rnootropics_i_need_your_helpinput_with_an/,158,1425344705.0,"I posted this in /r/Psychonaut and someone suggested I post it here.

Hey /r/nootropics, I need your help/input.

I'm autistic and I've used psys (mainly LSD) to fix my life. I went from on-the-brink-of-homeless to working/studying in the field of neuroscience and therapy.. I still regularly experiment on myself with various drugs and I still need psys to keep my life in order.

The biggest problem I have is that psys give me insights, but the associated emotions and feelings don't last. So, when I'm off them, I STILL have to fight against my consciousness all day to function normally, but my insights into my own psyche and the human psyche make it easier.

Microdoses are pretty much a cure for autism for me. If I'm on a microdose of LSD or mescaline, I have perfect days, utterly perfect. Psychedelic tolerance is a big issue and my ""golden egg"" in life is trying to circumvent it.

I have found a bit of a roundabout way to do it, and I'd like your input, and if anyone is willing to try it I'd be very grateful for some feedback.

Basically, I've mixed a couple of seeds/plants into a type of coffee that mimics the feeling of a microdose, for me anyway. The ingredients are:

* 1/4 teaspoon of powderized guarana (I just chuck the nuts in a blender, but there's more efficient ways to do it)
* 1/8 teaspoon of powderized nutmeg (this has to be fresh from the nuts, processed nutmeg won't do the trick)
* 1 teaspoon of raw cacao
* 1 teaspoon of any coffee powder, I use mocca

The active chemicals in this mix are 

* **caffeine** (*guarana* and *coffee*)
* **theobromine** (*guarana* and *raw cacao*)
* **MAOI** (tetrahydro-β-carboline, *raw cacao*)
* **elimicin** (precursor to mescaline, *nutmeg*)
* **myristicin** (precursor to MMDA, *nutmeg*)

All of these combine to give an experience that lasts roughly 6-8 hours. This experience feels almost identical to an LSD microdose (around 10-15mcgs). Elevated energy, colour enhancement, creativity enhancement, massive amounts of energy, positive and magical feeling to the day. I have used it consistently for a while now and it has been EXTREMELY effective. I doubt it's a placebo but I can't be sure, which is why I'm posting here. I can't discuss any of this stuff with my colleagues or in my faculty for obvious reasons.

If anyone has some input or is willing to try out this brew for themselves that would be awesome.

(Please note that raw cacao is not the same as cocoa. Cocoa is heated and processed cacao, and in a lot of cases it has sugars added to it as well. Raw cacao is just the bean, which actually tastes quite bitter and is a bit chunky)

(**UPDATE** Four experience reports so far. One person with autism who had a nearly identical experience, one person who had a productive day, colour enhancement and increased focus, but needed to redose on coffee, and one person with anxiety, colour enhancement, and one person with no effects.

**FURTHER UPDATE** It would seem that this brew is DEFINITELY active, except it varies from person to person, but it's not always the intended results. In the majority of cases, similar effects are experienced, but not all of them. Only in the case of one other user, who has autism like me, were the effects identical. I can rule out a placebo in that case since I didn't tell him what it would do, and his description was pretty much identical to mine. In about 10-15% of the users, no effects were experienced. Take from this what you will!)",2015-03-02 20:05:05

IT WILL NOT LAST FOREVER.  This is extremely important to know when experimenting with nootropics because some can put you in a bad mood, dangerous state, or even suicidal.  If you are already depressed, you need to be EXTREMELY mindful of this.

If you take something and it makes you anxious, just stay calm, do some deep breathing and/or other calming activities, maybe have some calming foods, and wait it out.  You can always go to the bathroom if you are in a social, academic, or work setting.

Always remember the phrase, ""this too shall pass,"" just like anything in life.  Don't attach to any one thought or mood and think you will be that way forever.  Just let the nootropic wear off and realize you will be back to normal soon.  **Bottom line:** be AWARE of yourself and DETACHED when you try nootropics.

PS: You should learn mindfulness for life in general, it is a wonderful tool.  We all know life can throw some wicked, unexpected curveballs.",2017-01-19 09:53:06

It's also sometimes funny when you talk with a person about some brain related phenomenon and he doesn't know a jack shit about what's actually going on. Instead of saying straight up ""I don't know, it's complicated"" he mumbles something about dopamine or serotonin. You are supposed to play the dopamine or serotonin card to sound insightful when talking about the brain.

Are we trying to explain too many things with neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine? Even some high-quality articles fall into that category.

I made an app for keeping track of the nootropics I've tried and when I take them. Now it's free to the public!,220,eefuan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/eefuan/i_made_an_app_for_keeping_track_of_the_nootropics/,68,1577105837.0,"**What's good y'all, happy holidays.**

You might have seen a similar post from me before. About a year ago I was looking for an app that would track all of my substance and nootropic use in a good looking interface with a focus on privacy, but everything was either stored online or not geared towards what I wanted; or more of a journal that could be used for tracking anything.

I knew a little bit of coding (I dropped out of my second Computer Science class) but I figured I would start a side project in my free time. I started working on an app that my friends and I used to track our substance use. I put out the first version on Easter and since then I've brought in around 15,000 downloads which honestly *blows my fucking mind.*

I'm coming back with an update because I recently released a completely new version of the app now that I've learned a lot more about app development. Basically, I gutted the whole thing and started over. It may be a lateral move with minimal increase in features but it's a lot more secure and is actually coded properly.

**Everything is stored locally on your device** (focusing on privacy) and it's easy to use and nice to look at. Data can be viewed in many ways including custom metrics *(When was the last time I took this nootropic? What is my average dosage for this nootropic?)*, and can be **exported/backed up** to a spreadsheet or **deleted** at any time.

It's been *so fucking awesome* to watch this little project I started actually become part of someone's daily routine.

I put 200 hours into this update over the last 6 weeks and it's finally at a point where I thought I would share it once again. I'm currently working on things like:

- Reminders to take medications or to check in x amount of time after taking something
- Graphs and charts to visualize data and compare to the past
- Securing with Touch ID or Face ID
- More metrics/queries and abilities to track specific statistics
- *For you legacy users: I'm bringing back the ability to see entries in a plain list, since I know the whole cell block thing was a major shift and some people prefer it the other way*

The app is **totally free** to download. I have a tier for a dollar a month after 100 entries but it's really only meant to either serve as a donation or for power users. Even if you use Tablets once a day for 3 months you won't hit the limit, I haven't had a single person reach the max since I implemented the rule lol.

Liftmode is currently selling these masks for $14.88 each, whereas the market price before price gouging began was less than $1 per *unopened* N95 mask, according to a [Wired Story about price gouging on masks.](https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-amazon-curb-face-mask-price-gouging/)

**Warning** - these masks are unreliable because they have been opened. Do not purchase them. The manufacturer, 3M, says the [expiration date is only valid for masks in original packaging](https://safetytownsquare.3mcanada.ca/articles/why-do-disposable-respirators-have-a-defined-shelf-life). The Wired story also warns about shady vendors like Liftmode opening and repacking masks. Liftmode does not clarify what the expiration date is. In addition, the surgeon general recently warned people to stop buying masks, as our panic buying prevents medical professionals from obtaining the masks they need. [(Source: CNN)](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/485332-surgeon-general-stop-buying-masks). Liftmode is directly contributing to the erosion of public health through diverting packages of masks away from the medical professionals who need them most.

Here are [screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ySnHEWz) of the liftmode email and website that show the fear tactics they use to advertise their price-gouged and ineffective wares.

I have given Liftmode a lot of money and always thought of them as a reputable company. But I will never shop there again because of this incredibly unethical profiteering scheme. I have also reported them to Amazon, who is cracking down on price gouging vendors. I encourage you to similarly stop patronizing and start reporting Liftmode for their utterly unethical practices.

(**EDIT 2:** Liftmode AND Newmind are owned by Synaptent LLC. Please consider avoiding Newmind as well as liftmode for this appalling display of opportunism. Thanks for the tip u/flemmeolympique.)

(**EDIT 3:** u/liftmode has give some responses. I hope you read them, but I'm not satisfied by the flimsy and contradictory excuses. Favorite excuse, for example, is that these masks are non-medical, so they couldn't help doctors stay safe anyway. BUT they can still help Liftmode customers stay safe. I also was not surprised to see their musings on capitalism and socialism and 1488, plus their predictions of the future. Nor to see their ""people like me"" comment. Stay away my friends.)

One day, I promise to compile a comprehensive overview of my near-decade of experiences with a matrix of psychoactive compounds. Today, however, I would like to prevent an experience report for a most peculiar compound. This post is well over a year in the making and, unless I am mistaken, I am the only human being who has experience Imidazenil.

So how did we get here?

There are many researchers on the nootropics subreddit well known for their extensive knowledge regarding GABA based anxiolytics. Their posts, which are easy to search for, piqued my interest which quickly propelled into a passionate obsession. I will avoid delving too much into my interest in GABA based anxiolytics but years of seeing friends lost to alcohol, watched others spiral out on certain benzodiazepines, reading Phenibut withdrawal horror stories, and, at the end of the day, feeling very not alone in wanting a better, safer, therapeutic anxiolytic.

**Enter GABAA positive allosteric modulators**

This [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/awt118/comprehensive_list_of_gabaa_receptor_anxiolytics/) written by u/CL20 was perhaps my first exposure to understanding benzodiazepine agonism/antagonism and the subunits of GABAA. I highly encourage everyone reading this to read his overview of GABAA subunits. The salient note is that agonism of the GABAA a1 subunit is most susceptible to tolerance buildup and addiction as well as responsible for sedation and memory impairment.

>In the light of current evidence, α1 dormant, α2, α3, and α5 subtype partial agonists not only possess low abuse potential but are also low or devoid of tolerance building. There is evidence that α1 containing GABAA receptors directly contributes to the downstream effects of tolerance because α1 (H101R) mice have been shown to maintain expressions in neuroplasticity-coding transcripts after diazepam administration.120 This perfectly agrees with data from animal studies regarding the lack of tolerance in α1 subtype inactive compounds such as TPA023B and imidazenil.121–126 Future drug discovery involving tranquilizers should look for partial agonists of α2 , α3 , and α5 containing GABAA receptors; Valium without its side effects is potentially achievable.

**From Wikipedia**:

**Imidazenil**[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-1) is an experimental [anxiolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) drug which is derived from the [benzodiazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) family, and is most closely related to other imidazobenzodiazepines such as [midazolam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midazolam), [flumazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil), and [bretazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretazenil).

Imidazenil is a highly potent [benzodiazepine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_receptor) [partial agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-2) with an unusual profile of effects, producing some of the effects associated with normal benzodiazepines such as [anticonvulsant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) and [anxiolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects, yet without any notable [sedative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative) or [amnestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnestic)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-3) effects. In fact, Imidazenil blocks the sedative effects of [diazepam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam), yet without lowering the convulsion threshold,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-4) and so potentially could be a more flexible antidote than the antagonist [flumazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil) which is commonly used to treat [benzodiazepine overdose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_overdose) at present.

Imidazenil has not yet been developed commercially for use in humans, however it has been suggested as a safe and effective treatment for [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety),[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-5) a potent yet non-sedating anticonvulsant which might be particularly useful in the treatment of poisoning with organophosphate [nerve agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_agent),[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-7) and as a novel treatment for [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-8)

**Experience**:

The synthesis for Imidazenil was not easy or quick. Nevertheless, I received a tested batch of the compound and have been evaluating it at various dosages. In my experience, the literature appears accurate. Here are my key takeaways after several weeks of near-daily use at various dosages, but mostly 500mcg-1.5mg. I rarely felt the need to increase my dosage beyond:

* A tremendous reduction in anxiety and ruminating thoughts. Very direct and targeted in this regard. If I could compare the anxiolytic effects to anything, I find 1mg of Imidazenil to be akin to \~1g of Phenibut combined with 50mg of Fasoracetam.
* No noticeable tolerance buildup whatsoever. Does not appear to synergize with alcohol….at all? THIS IS EXTREMELY ILL-ADVISED so please stay safe and don’t be stupid. However, I find Imidazenil appears to *increase* my tolerance to alcohol rather than decrease it. While I am obviously on the more cavalier side of this community, there is something about the effects of this compound that do not compel me to increase the dosage. I found the Goldilocks zone out of the box and have essentially stayed there.
   * Potential restoration of tolerance for other GABAergic compounds.
* I never experienced any loss of coordination, amnesia, or hypnotic effects. Again, it echoes the nootropic aspects of Fasoracetam.
* Definite and noticeable dopaminergic modulation. This compound plays *excellently* with all stimulants I combined it with, from pre-workouts to phenidates. Akin to caffeine + L-Theanine, Imidizaneil + DRIs produce a much less jaggy experience.  It almost reminds me of certain effects with low-dose Naltrexone.
* Paradoxical effects on energy. It wakes me up in the morning while nuking fogginess. It helps me fall asleep quicker and stay asleep.
* Increased libido and performance in the bed very similar to Phenibut. I have not noticed increased libido from any other GABAergic that I can think of.
* Discontinuation without tapering for over a week with no ill-effects.
* I am significantly less chatty on this compound. In social situations, I am clearly engaged but rather quiet. This is atypical for me.

**Conclusion**:

It is nice to finally experience another “next-generation” compound since the NSI-189, Dihexa, and P21 days. I realize this will be flagged as “high-risk” (as it should be), but as someone who previously vilified benzodiazepines and never considered seeking them out, I please encourage the more responsible members of this community to realize what this compound may mean for the safety of millions seeking relief from anxiety.

This is truly a special compound that is an improvement to traditional benzodiazepine anxiolytics in every way I can think of. By no means am I planning on staying on this for the rest of my life, but out of all my experiences with the subject matter related to this sub, this has been by far the most rewarding, interesting, and potentially game-changing discovery.

Looking forward to continuing this dialogue.",2019-10-26 21:35:37

Can somebody explain what this means exactly?

I guess caffeine blocks serotonin & gaba in the short-term so you have less available... but then there's a long-term overcompensation effect so that on days where you don't drink coffee you have more GABA & Serotonin available?

Can somebody explain how to look at this?

I can only speculate that on the days where I stop caffeine I go into an overly parasympathetic but not very comfortable state (more gaba and serotonin release?) where I'm not particularly interested in doing anything at all (might be withdrawal tough)... my sleep is better too.

The gradual yet not-so-subtle cognitive impairments of my magnesium supplementation,218,dvxtlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dvxtlb/the_gradual_yet_notsosubtle_cognitive_impairments/,128,1573706042.0,"I originally started taking magnesium to help me sleep, which it did, at first. It helped me fall asleep more quickly and also allowed me to fall back asleep earlier if I woke up before my intended waking time.

This obviously led to more sleep on average per night. I was also remembering my dreams better and feeling more rested in the morning. So I took it daily before bed (400 mg of this stuff [https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Best-Absorption-Magnesium-Glycinate/dp/B000BD0RT0](https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Best-Absorption-Magnesium-Glycinate/dp/B000BD0RT0)) for about 2 years.

I also felt that the Mag led helped curb some of my mild anxiety (which it's been shown to do [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27869100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27869100)).

However, it didn't come without side effects. Over time, I started to suspect that both my memory and my verbal acuity were lapsing due to the magnesium. This was barely perceptible for a long time because, I believe, the effects were gradual, which allowed them to be normalized by my own perspective.

However, the effects became quite clear to me one time when I went without magnesium for the first time in over a year. I was on vacation and had forgotten to pack my magnesium so I went to bed without it, and the next morning I awoke to a sense of heightened cognitive functioning.

I was no longer pausing to search for the right word in conversation, which I then realized had become a frequent occurrence while supplementing magnesium, and even my internal monologue seemed much more fluid. I was able to form more robust ideas much more quickly, and I also felt that I was able to communicate them more clearly to others, largely because my memory was better and my recall was quicker.

Simply put, I just felt ""smarter"". And this feeling lasted for the duration of the vacation, although after a few days the lack of quality sleep became more apparent.

Since then I've experimented with smaller dosages and cycling magnesium, and there seems to be a tradeoff between the quality sleep and anxiolytic effects of supplementing magnesium vs the slight decrease in cognitive functioning and memory impairment.

I did a little research and found some studies that seem to support my hunches:

Magnesium competes to block synaptic functioning in the NMDA receptors ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261381](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261381)) which are crucial to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA\_receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor)).

So if you're taking magnesium I suggest experimenting with time off from supplementing and/or adjusting your intake. I had no idea that it was affecting me at all cognitively, and some of you may be in the same boat.

Would love to hear any thoughts you guys have about this.

Edit: The current top comment is claiming I am basing this on a single experience on vacation. The commenter apparently didn't read the paragraph a few above this one where I mentioned that I tried this altering the dosage and cycling afterwards. Nowhere in this post do I claim a monopoly on the truth. This was simply meant to be a launch point for discussion and the sharing of experiences.

Edit 2: if anyone started getting blue dots in their field of vision (particularly around the time you started taking magnesium) let me know. This happens pretty often when I stand up too fast, and I’m wondering if it’s related to magnesium supplementation.",2019-11-13 23:34:02

""Are there any nootropics to make my girlfriend do anal?""


I may have made that last one up, but you get the point. The definition of ""nootropic"" is already kind of vague -- a drug that improves cognitive function -- but it seems that we are taking any specificity that's left out of the definition. ""Nootropic"" is being used to mean ""a drug that does what I want but lets me call it something else other than a drug."" I don't know if it's because people want to feel superior in some way, or they don't like to admit that they're using drugs, or what the reasoning is, but it seems like the word ""nootropic"" is quickly becoming totally meaningless here... there are more and more instances of the term ""nootropic"" being used simply as a synonym for ""drug"".


If you want a ""nootropic"" to reduce your appetite, you want an appetite suppressant or a stimulant, not a nootropic. Are some stimulants also nootropics? Sure. But not all.
If you want a ""nootropic"" to help you get to sleep at night, you want a tranquilizer/depressant, or some other drug that promotes sleep, not a nootropic.

Yes, drugs can be useful for these purposes... but unless these purpose involve *cognitive enhancement*, you aren't talking about nootropics, you're just talking about drugs.

Magnesium eliminated my anxiety.,215,gdo15h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/gdo15h/magnesium_eliminated_my_anxiety/,101,1588668896.0,"Background:

&#x200B;

From my last bloodwork in June last year, my result showed deficiency in vitamin D (20 ng/ml), normal level (right in the middle) of calcium. I've been having anxiety issues for few years, mostly related to driving, and low motivation/energy in general. My diet is skewed, and I know for a fact that I don't get all the enough nutrients.

&#x200B;

I've been trying out different supplements to help with my anxiety along with therapy. I particularly was drawn to magnesium for its effect on anxiety, after not much success with L-theanine. I'm too much of a chicken to try things like lion's mane etc, something that i can't track with the currently available blood level testing.

&#x200B;

I firstly tried with magnesium glycinate (2 pills = 200mg) for about 3-4 weeks, and it made little to no change, if not worse. I was taking VitD 5000 iu but honestly I don't know if it helped me either.

&#x200B;

Then recently I've been doing more research, and learned how close the fat soluble vitamins work together (A,D,K,E), the relationship between them plus mag and calcium--and I can't just cherry pick the ones that I wanna take. My doctor didn't say much about which supplements i should take either, since I'm younger with no PMH.

&#x200B;

So now, I've been taking: vitamin ADK combo, magnesium l-threonate, calcium carbonate 300mg, and vit B complex. And my driving anxiety--the one I had most difficulty dealing with-- is gone. It's been about 2 weeks now.

&#x200B;

Let me explain further: yes, the supplements can only do so much. Back then, even when my rational thoughts were never compromised, my irrational thoughts would linger-- I would ruminate, and I couldn't shake them. My rational counteracts to those thoughts were NOT effective. And because I also had low energy, for some reason I get nervous and the fight or flight reactions would trigger.

&#x200B;

Now, I have more energy. I don't mean much physical, but my motivation and mental excitement is back. Just today I actually voluntarily got into my car and drove through traffic (I don't do this unless I have to), because I wanted to make something for myself tonight. My anxious thought were there, sure, but they didn't have much strength, and they didn't linger. I was just overall calm. And I thought to myself, ""wow, is this what it's like living without anxiety and fear?"" It was wonderful.

&#x200B;

So overall, I just wanted to share how my experience went. It could've been little bit of everything, not just mag itself, but I do wanna give more credit to magtin since my experience with mag glycinate was not pleasant.

I will be getting my annual bloodwork again soon, and I just CANNOT wait to see how my levels will look now to compare.",2020-05-05 04:54:56

"The battle against depressive symptoms: My experience with piracetam, Lions mane, psychedelics, MDMA, edibles, etc.",213,e218b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/e218b2/the_battle_against_depressive_symptoms_my/,118,1574818159.0,"Male, 23, ADHD, healthy lifestyle (fitness, good food with all micronutrients 'n stuff, no alcohol or smoking, last year consistently used vitamine D and fish oil supplements), 'gifted' intelligence (no not flexing, this might be an important factor)

(Also not from an english speaking country so bear with me.)

As you can see in the title I have tried a list of substances (and other things) deliberately or accidentely against depressive symptoms (I wouldn't call it straight up depression but it dips into it sometimes). I'm writing this as a reminder to myself of what does and doesn't work and as advice for others. If a substance I listed is illegal in your country you probably don't want to expose yourself to legal issues for a chance at improving your depression if you haven't tried all legal routes.. (But what's legal and illegal is a pretty arbitrary line so I wouldn't absolutely advice against, just know what you're doing please. Inform yourself.)
Okay enough stalling, here it is:

Substances tried for a longer period (each day):

- Piracetam (with a choline source): maybe the first few days (attack-dose) a tiny bit of increase in visual sharpness and/or saturation? Didn't notice anything else above possible placebo limit. For me this was kind of a waste of time tbh. Might try again when I'm mentally deteriorating from old age.

- Lions mane. (Yes, ""the right one"", with the Nerve Growth Factor) This one did seem to work against depressive symptoms and anxiety a tiny bit. But after a week or two no noticable effects anymore.

- Microdosing (LSD, because it was the easiest to dose, more energetic than shrooms, dirt-cheap, long-lasting): Who knew putting an incredible potent mind-altering susbtance in 1/10 the usual amount in your brain really does some stuff? Too many people don't at least. This one increases mindfulness, sociability (because of increased interest in others) and creativity. It worked for me against depressive symptoms because it breaks me out of habits that play into the depressive symptoms. And the mindfulness helps against anxiety (but I can imagine how it can also work against you). The increased interest in stuff helps against ADHD a tiny bit, does nothing for focus though and with a bit larger doses is actually terrible for focus.

- Not a nootropic but should be noted anyways: exercise (strength training). Humans really have not evolved to thrive with doing nothing physically. You should be exercising, for your own sake. Obvious health benefits but more importantly: increased confidence (and this is major against depression and anxiety long term) and for the short term also a decrease in overthinking.

- Psychedelics (LSD and mushrooms primarily): The reason for this post. I was forgotten how extremely helpful they can be. Just a low dose of mushrooms has boosted my mindfulness for days (which decreases anxiety, which decreases depressive symptoms). I gained some perspective and can more easily 'shove away' thoughts that are unhelpful instead of them getting stuck in my head. This has worked time and time again, BUT there is the risk of a bad trip for inexperienced users and/or people who don't know what they're doing which can give someone PTSD. Other risks are negligible tho. Personally I don't feel like I could even get a bad trip (especially with the low-medium doses I do) because of pretty alright meta-cognitive skills (meditation, facing issues instead of hiding from them, seeing things in perspective, etc.), but again, evaluate the risks for yourself. Edit: stumbled upon [this](https://www.livescience.com/psilocybin-depression-breakthrough-therapy.html) just now, I swear I didn't plan it.

- MDMA: Probably great for PTSD and (other) emotional blockades (relationship troubles) but it did nothing really for me. I mean great experience but against depressive or anxiety symptoms it doesn't do shit long-term. You think in the moment ""I probably should do/react in this way instead of the inhibited/less-loving/less-open way I usually react"" but that's the you flooded with serotonin that doesn't get how the world (sadly) works (and you and other people when not on MDMA..).

- Edibles. I only included these to provide the most information I could but I don't think anybody considers weed as an option against depression.. And rightfully so, during the experience you're frustrated because you have a bit of the same motivation as psychedelics to do useful shit with your life but you're too incapable (physically and mentally) to do that, plan it or even remember it in a useful manner. And the next day you're slowly recovering, and being an incapable person (for at least two days) doesn't help against depressive symptoms... So no.",2019-11-26 20:29:19

Nootropics useless without sleep & diet,214,c3cuf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/c3cuf7/nootropics_useless_without_sleep_diet/,99,1561163512.0,"Hey everyone, I would like to hear your thoughts on a topic my friend and I were discussing.

For me nootropics only work efficiently when taken on top of a good lifestyle. Simply eating 8 pills doesn't substitute missing sleep & eating poorly. In my opinion it should be used in moderation and form a combined synergy with sleep, diet and lifestyle choices. 

It's frustrating me because he seems to believe his ""stack"" can repair and replenish his body well enough alone.

"The TRUE mechanism of Ketamine's antidepressant's effect (NOT NMDAR mediated, dangerous misinformation)",212,fy2c8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/fy2c8e/the_true_mechanism_of_ketamines_antidepressants/,139,1586500843.0,"**NMDA antagonism alone does not cause AD effects.

Neither do the effects rely on (direkt) AMPA interaction (at least not to a significant degree, downstream effects aside).

One of ketamines metabolite, **(2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine** (of which's concetration, besides the 2r6r isomere, corrrelates with the antidepressant effect) is not significantly active at NMDAR. ***Mostly, it is a highly potent negative allosteric modulator of alpha7 nicotinic receptors. Inhibition of metabolism to HNK inhibited any antidepressent effect of Ketamine.***

&#x200B;

It has to be said tho that with racemic ketamine/R-Ketamine, 2R6R-HNK is formed, which actually *has relevant action on NMDAR (ki: \~7mcM), which is very weak compared to the affinity to alpha 7 (<1mcM).* Considering the S,S-Isomer is about equipotent and has no relevant action on nmdar, it might not be insignificant, but pretty much irrelevant at common concentrations.

&#x200B;

Other NAMs at nACh a7 have already been shown to have incredibly robust anti anxiety effects, where as ampakines failed to create sufficient antidpressant effects. I'd say case closed. (EDIT: TAKE THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT JFC) Either way, here's the evidence:

***EDIT: I've seen many comments saying that blocking of NK metabolism to HNK doesn't block the antidepressant action, but NK itself is very potent at alpha7 too. to put it simply, same action + more nmda action. And since 2s,6sHNK alone exhibits almost identical AD effects, and other NMDA antagonists don't, i believe we can rule out nmda antagonism. speculation. grain of salt. but logically, the only possible explanation i can think of given the (llimited) evidence.***

# EDIT: PROOF THAT ALPHA 7 NAMs EXERT POTENT AND IMMEDIATE ANTIDEPRESSANT/ANXIOLYTIC EFFECTS

&#x200B;

My takeaway:

&#x200B;

i've already known that alpha7 NAMs are effective as ADs/anxiolytics. Under normal conditions, HNK is the main mediator of AD effects. blocking metabolism of NK to HNK does yield the same AD effect, and since HK happens to be a very potent a7 inhibitory ligand as well, we can't rule out a7 activity. What we can rule out tho, is that NMDA antagonism does not yield the desired effects, which leaves us with a7 NAM as responsible MoA. Ket's potency at other known targets seems to be to weak to explain it's AD effect. Furthermore, AD effect timeline accurately correlates to concentration of NK/HNK relative to their potency at a7.

the fact that other a7 NAMs exert similar fast acting AD effects further strengthens my thesis.

In contrast to ketamine and norketamine, HNK is inactive as an [anesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic) and [psychostimulant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychostimulant).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-LeungBaillie1986-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-Wainer2014-5) In accordance, it has only very weak [affinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)) for the [NMDA receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor) (Ki = 21.19 μM and > 100 μM for (2*S*,6*S*)-HNK and (2*R*,6*R*)-HNK, respectively).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-MoaddelAbdrakhmanova2013-6) However, HNK does still show [biological activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity), having been found to act as a potent and selective [negative allosteric modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_allosteric_modulator) of the [α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-7_nicotinic_receptor) ([IC50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50) < 1 μM).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-MoaddelAbdrakhmanova2013-6) Moreover, (2*S*,6*S*)-HNK was tested and was found to increase the function of the [mammalian target of rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin) (mTOR), a marker of the [antidepressant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant) activity of ketamine, far more potently than ketamine itself (0.05 nM for (2*S*,6*S*)-HNK, 10 nM for (*S*)-norketamine, and 1,000 nM for (*S*)-ketamine ([esketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esketamine)), respectively), an action that was observed to correlate closely with their ability to inhibit the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-PaulSingh2014-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-van_VelzenDahan2014-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-Anisman2015-9) This finding has led to a call of reassessment of the understanding of the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine and their mechanisms.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-SinghZarate2014-10) However, subsequent research has found that [dehydronorketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydronorketamine), which is a potent and selective [antagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor similarly to HNK, is inactive in the [forced swim test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_swim_test) at doses up to 50 mg/kg in mice, and this is in contrast to ketamine and norketamine, which are effective at doses of 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-pmid26240948-11)

In May 2016, a study published in the journal [Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)) determined that HNK, specifically (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, is responsible for the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in mice; administration of (2R,6R)-HNK demonstrated ketamine-type antidepressant-like effects, and preventing the metabolic conversion of ketamine into HNK blocked the antidepressant-like effects of the parent compound.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ScienceDaily2016-13) As (2R,6R)-HNK, unlike ketamine, is not an NMDA receptor antagonist, and produces no dissociative or euphoric effects, it has consequently been concluded that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may in fact not be mediated via the NMDA receptor.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ScienceDaily2016-13) This is tentative, as confirmation that the findings translate to humans is still needed,[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-14) but it is notable that published human data show a positive association between the antidepressant responses of ketamine and plasma (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK levels.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ScienceDaily2016-13) In accordance with the notion that the NMDA receptor is not responsible for the antidepressant effects of ketamine, [dizocilpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizocilpine) (MK-801), which binds to and blocks the same site on the NMDA receptor that ketamine does, lacks antidepressant-like effects.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12) Moreover, the findings would explain why other NMDA receptor antagonists such as [memantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memantine), [lanicemine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanicemine), and [traxoprodil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traxoprodil) have thus far failed to demonstrate ketamine-like antidepressant effects in human clinical trials.\[12\]",2020-04-10 02:40:43

Secondly because the DHA in roe is in phospholipid form which allows it to be transported directly to the brain. the DHA in most capsules is not in this form.

>A form of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, with its own transporter.
Salmon roe is rich in the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA. Not all DHA forms are created equal, however. The DHA in salmon roe is in phospholipid form, which may play a unique role in human physiology. It turns out that humans and some animals have a transporter, called Mfsd2a, in their brains. This transporter targets the phospholipid form of DHA and moves it into the brain. Research has shown that animals that have been genetically modified to lack Mfsd2a transporters have 60% less DHA in their brains compared to normal animals. Other research shows that humans who have a mutation in the gene that encodes for the Mfsd2a transporter develop early neurodegeneration.

I've been dosing 200mg Modafinil for 12 months - My Personal Experience.,211,898l35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/898l35/ive_been_dosing_200mg_modafinil_for_12_months_my/,127,1522753651.0,"Hi there folks, I've been a reader here for quite a while but i haven't engaged a whole lot, however i feel as if i'm at a point where i can share an experience of mine with the use of Nootropics. This is going to be a relatively long post, however I will leave a Dot-point summary at the base.

I began using Modafinil (Modalert) close to 12 months ago, after hearing about it on a Podcast, and ignorantly and easily persuaded me decided to order some to try it out for myself. I'm going to start this with a brief experience overview followed by some Positives Vs. Negatives i have experienced.

**My overall experiences**

I take Modafinil two days per week, back to back at a 200mg dosage per day, generally at around 12pm (midday), often with or just after eaten lunch.

My initial experience for the first 4-6 doses was incredible, I 'felt' a difference, I could consciously feel myself paying far greater attention to my work (i was running a E-Commerce business at the time in addition to a Full-time job) and having little-to-no brain fog at all, which for me was an absolute godsend, as I am generally a pretty anxious/easily distracted person.

Skipping forward about 6 months, whilst still taking the same doses, at the same times, those feelings no longer come. If i think about it on a day to day basis, I am marginally more alert than without it, however if feels although the effects are no longer as strong as they once were - this could come down to my tolerance level, but I would have assumed taking it only twice a week, that I wouldn't build a tolerance... please let me know if I am wrong.

At this present moment in time, I continue to cycle Modafinil, at the same levels as before, on the same days. The story has not changed since 6 months ago.

------------------------------------

However, one thing I HAVE noticed, is that when I dose modafinil whilst working at my day-time job, on the days i dont regularly dose, the effects are greatly felt. I work in Sales, and the benefits are crazy. I am FAR quicker on my feet in terms of responses to questions from customers, i can bring product knowledge to my tongue lightning fast, I become more witty, I never get distracted and overall i just feel like i'm 'pingin''... the Benefits go on! I guess, I feel as though I become a well-greased wheel in my Sales role when using Modafinil - and my sales figures often represent higher conversions, higher ticket price sales, all the while being faster and obviously more effective. 

i've tested this theory many times in the last twelve months. It's important for me to mention that I have also ruled out a Placebo effect by blindfolding myself, and allowing housemates to give me either one dose of Modafinil or a common vitamin.

To cut the long story short, I feel as though the effects in my experience of using Modafinil have worn off greatly, again, this may be due to a tolerance build up, and I may have to step up my dosage to feel full effects. I feel although the drug is marketed in the wrong way - a lot of first time users assume they will have crazy super human abilities as depicted in movies - this for me is far from the truth. However general memory recall is raised marginally.

Summing up, for those who didn't want to read my poorly written essay:

**Positives** - 

- Marginally increased Memory Recall.
- When the dosage is right, and no tolerance is built up, I experienced laser like focus on my business work.
- Brain Fog decreases tremendously.
- Not a bad pre-workout (I say this half joking), I have felt an increased focus on lifting weights, better technique, and less overall awareness of being tired/less-energy, compared to normal workouts without dosing.
- Ability to talk faster
- Less time needed to think of answers on my feet
- Ability to recognise distractions and cut them out earlier than normal.

**Negatives** - 

- Problems sleeping from time-to-time.
- Brain fog the day after a dose upon waking
- I personally feel that in order to feel effects you cannot just take it and do a normal day - you need mental stimuli and to be working on a project that requires great attention to detail - this is when i notice the full effects.
- Urine smells like Acid.
- Headaches upon taking initial doses, also when not drinking enough water.

Thanks for allowing me to share, and if not for anything else i would love to hear your own personal takeaways from using Modafinil, and if anyone has information on Tolerance build up regarding my dosage, please let me know. I'm all ears.",2018-04-03 07:07:31

"If you're going to take a cold shower, take a cold shower.",213,5u6xmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5u6xmc/if_youre_going_to_take_a_cold_shower_take_a_cold/,163,1487188545.0,"I see lots of people saying they take cold showers but then reveal in actuality they do something like a 10 minute hot shower with a token 60 second cold finish or a few 30 second cold shots. It's a stretch to call this a cold shower and you are probably missing out on most of the benefits and just making yourself uncomfortable. This isn't about ego, it's about getting the therapeutic dose if you're going to put yourself through the discomfort of cold water in the first place. 

According to [Rhonda's paper](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/news/s/d5oth5/new_20-page_report_on_cryotherapy_just_released_cold_shock_boosts_norepinephrine_up_to_5-fold_increase_type_of_immune_cell_that_kills_tumor_cells) on this a lot of the good stuff happens around a 2 degree drop in body temperature and if you look at the hour long soaks at cold temperature it took to get there it's obvious a little 30-90 second exposure isn't going to do anything.

>It appears that a 2°F reduction in core body temperature is e nough to induce cold shock proteins, including RBM3, in human astrocytes (a type of brain cell). By way of example, in one study, young men that stayed submerged in cold water of 68°F (20°C) for one hour were able to l ower their rectal temperature to around 96.9°F (36.1°C) or if they stayed in 57.2oF (14oC) water for 1 hour they were able to lower their temperature to 96.1°F (35.6°C).

I did a big writeup here tracking my biometrics [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/) mostly on sauna but I have a section on cold shower. About 10-15 minutes of straight cold in 57F shower water I was able to get to 97.1F core temp.

I have shitty tolerance for cold water but the miserableness goes away if you just stick it out for a couple minutes. I intended to 'ease in' my first time but after 30 seconds I just said fuck it and kept going and then got warm after a minute and went to a full 15 minutes. When you go hot cold you're just subjecting yourself to the worst part over and over and getting much less benefit. 

Unless you have one of those crazy showers that hits you from all angles or doing cold water immersion you're only getting focused cold application in one spot while the other 80% of you is in lukewarm purgatory so you need time for it to drop your body temperature.

Cold showers are such a powerful thing for your health, more powerful than any sleep supplement, nootropic, or fat burning supplement I've tried, and it's a shame to see most people simply not doing it right. Once you get to two minutes it's just as easy to go to 15. 

>But my water is reeeeeally cold

First, actually measure that shit because without a thermometer most people who haven't done much with cold water think their water is literally a just-shy-of-ice 35F when it's actually 70F (talking from experience). If you're in a standalone home in Minnesota then you have an excuse, or you are really lucky. If you live in a city, high rise, etc this is especially important as your water is probably a lot warmer. Second, cryotherapy chambers go to -264F and a session is 3 minutes, 2:30 for noobs. You should at the very least be able to make it to 6-10+ minutes in a steamy 60F shower.

Since this is /r/nootropics and you want a pill for everything, I've read that Tyrosine increases cold tolerance so this could take the edge off, but I haven't tried it. However, if you're doing this at night it might also keep you up and mess up the amazing sleep inducing benefit of cold showers.

Also, as I mentioned in my [previous writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/), the addition of a sauna followed by cold shower is a magnificent combination and makes the initial part much easier. 

It didn't do much for me but apparently Wim Hof breathing helps with pain tolerance. 

If your shower is much above 65F I honestly don't know if I would bother, I haven't found any research finding biochemical changes above that. I think above 65F the only cold shower benefits you are retaining are mental fortitude and nice skin/hair, which is still nice. You'd be better off just going outside for your cold exposure, though. In the summer I would look into ice baths or check out the Cool Fat Burner ice vest. 

There is an option if you do want super fast cold exposure and that is cold water immersion in very very cold water.

>There have been studies comparing the norepinephrine response to cold­water immersion (whole body submerged for 20 seconds in 40°F) with whole body cryotherapy (2 min at ­166°F) and found they are more or less identical, at least in that respect.

That is a lot of work, however, to set up for a 20 second dip and at that point you also might as well stay in for a full soak because

>Now, if you were to stay submerged in that cold water for an hour as opposed to just 20 seconds we know that norepinephrine would increase 5­fold. Which brings us back to the point that exposing the body to cold for prolonged periods may have a more robust effect.

One final trick you can do is drink a big glass of ice water before starting the shower. This will help increase the rate of cooling. 

tl;dr Stop pussyfooting around with the shower knob and just leave it on cold the whole time, it's less miserable than cycling and you might as well get the full benefits if you're going to make yourself miserable in the first place. 

PS. Body fat decrease after 6 weeks of sauna/cold shower
Since I linked to my previous [sauna+cold shower writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/) I figure I'd put an update in this post. I've continued my sauna+cold shower combo. I've averaged a bit more than every other day. I started this regimen after a couple months in a wheelchair and I was thoroughly deconditioned and my bodyfat had risen to 19-20% (using an omron handheld monitor). In about 6 weeks my last few readings have been 9.5-13%. I know these things aren't super accurate which you can see in the wide range but clearly this has shifted way beyond the error range. To put this into perspective I could never get it below 14% after months of workout out in prior years. This huge drop is despite not being in ketosis (though I am fairly low carb) and not being able to do 'big lifts' like deadlifts/squats (I've had to focus on upper body). So while I have optimized a lot of things I think clearly this heat/cold exposure training is having a massive effect. It feels like it is amplifying the exercise effects by a factor of two or more with less injury and a trivial amount of additional work.",2017-02-15 14:55:45

The placebo effect is far more powerful than I thought,209,ghpiv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ghpiv9/the_placebo_effect_is_far_more_powerful_than_i/,111,1589239216.0,"Gather 'round, here's a quick story for you.

I typically do not ""respond"" to most nootropics/ supplements, so when something works, it feels like a miracle. 

Recently, I picked up a CBD tincture for mitigating anxiety and have been swearing by it for the past few weeks.  I have tried many OTC products and haven't had any success.

It turns out that I haven't been dosing this properly, and I placebo'd myself into believing I was less anxious (and I actually was!).  One dose is a FULL dropper of oil; I have only been taking a single DROP.  This is about 1/30th the proper amount.

Just goes to show how susceptible one can be to the placebo effect.  I never considered that I could be so strongly affected by it as I've been hopeful for many substances in the past, only to feel nothing.  I felt profound relief from that drop when I had no pharmacological right to.",2020-05-11 19:20:16
